# R1 response

To determine the pH of the solution made by mixing 500 mL of 0.1 M CH₃COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)₂, we follow these steps:

1. **Calculate moles of H⁺ from HCl:**
   \[
   \text{Moles of HCl} = 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.4 \, \text{L} = 0.08 \, \text{mol}
   \]
   Since HCl is a strong acid, it dissociates completely, contributing 0.08 moles of H⁺.

2. **Calculate moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂:**
   \[
   \text{Moles of Ba(OH)₂} = 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol}
   \]
   Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ produces 2 moles of OH⁻, so:
   \[
   \text{Moles of OH⁻} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol}
   \]

3. **Neutralization reaction between H⁺ and OH⁻:**
   \[
   \text{H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O}
   \]
   Moles of H⁺ (0.08 mol) react with moles of OH⁻ (0.18 mol), leaving:
   \[
   \text{Excess OH⁻} = 0.18 \, \text{mol} - 0.08 \, \text{mol} = 0.10 \, \text{mol}
   \]

4. **Reaction of excess OH⁻ with CH₃COOH:**
   \[
   \text{Moles of CH₃COOH} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.05 \, \text{mol}
   \]
   Excess OH⁻ (0.10 mol) reacts with CH₃COOH (0.05 mol):
   \[
   \text{Excess OH⁻ after reaction} = 0.10 \, \text{mol} - 0.05 \, \text{mol} = 0.05 \, \text{mol}
   \]

5. **Calculate the concentration of excess OH⁻:**
   Total volume of the solution:
   \[
   500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L}
   \]
   Concentration of OH⁻:
   \[
   [\text{OH⁻}] = \frac{0.05 \, \text{mol}}{1.2 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.0417 \, \text{M}
   \]

6. **Calculate pH:**
   \[
   \text{pOH} = -\log(0.0417) \approx 1.38
   \]
   \[
   \text{pH} = 14 - 1.38 \approx 12.62
   \]

The pH of the solution is \boxed{12.62}.

# R1 reasoning

Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem here: I need to find the pH of a solution made by mixing 500 mL of 0.1 M acetic acid (CH3COOH), 400 mL of 0.2 M hydrochloric acid (HCl), and 300 mL of 0.3 M barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)2). Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.

First off, I remember that pH is a measure of the hydrogen ion concentration in a solution. To find the pH, I need to determine the concentration of H+ ions in the final solution after mixing all these components together. But wait, acetic acid is a weak acid, HCl is a strong acid, and barium hydroxide is a strong base. This means that when they mix, they will neutralize each other to some extent. So, this is a problem involving both strong acid-strong base neutralization and the presence of a weak acid.

Alright, let's start by figuring out the moles of each species involved. Since we're mixing different volumes and concentrations, I need to calculate the moles of H+ from the acids and the moles of OH- from the base, and see which one is in excess.

Starting with HCl: that's straightforward because it's a strong acid and dissociates completely. The moles of H+ from HCl would be the molarity multiplied by the volume. So 0.2 M * 0.4 L (since 400 mL is 0.4 liters) gives us 0.08 moles of HCl, which also gives 0.08 moles of H+, since HCl is monoprotic.

Next, barium hydroxide is a strong base, and each formula unit gives two OH- ions because Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ + 2OH-. So the moles of Ba(OH)2 are 0.3 M * 0.3 L (300 mL = 0.3 L) = 0.09 moles. Since each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH-, the total OH- moles will be 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles of OH-.

Now, let's consider acetic acid. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't fully dissociate. However, when a strong base is present, it can neutralize the strong base first. But here, we have both a strong acid and a strong base. So maybe the strong acid and strong base will neutralize each other first, and the remaining H+ or OH- will determine the pH, along with any contribution from the weak acid.

Wait, but actually, when you have a mixture of acids and bases, the strong acid and strong base will neutralize each other first, right? The H+ from HCl and the OH- from Ba(OH)2 will react to form water. Then, after that neutralization, whatever is left (excess H+ or excess OH-) will determine the pH. However, the acetic acid is a weak acid, so if after neutralization there is excess OH-, will it also react with the acetic acid? Or does the presence of a strong acid (HCl) prevent the weak acid from dissociating?

Hmm, actually, no. Here, the strong acid (HCl) will donate H+ ions which will shift the equilibrium of the acetic acid. Since HCl is a strong acid, it will completely dissociate, providing a lot of H+ ions. The acetate ion from the acetic acid might act as a base, but with excess H+, its dissociation is suppressed. So, in the presence of excess H+ from HCl, the acetic acid won't dissociate much; its contribution to the H+ concentration will be negligible compared to the strong acid and the neutralization with the strong base.

So maybe the approach here is:

1. Calculate moles of H+ from HCl (0.08 moles).

2. Calculate moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 (0.18 moles).

3. Subtract the moles of H+ and OH- (neutralization reaction: H+ + OH- → H2O) to find excess moles of either H+ or OH-.

But then, after neutralization, if there's excess H+ or OH-, we can calculate the concentration and thus the pH. But since we have acetic acid also present, after the neutralization, if there's excess H+, the solution will be acidic and the acetic acid (a weak acid) might contribute to the H+ concentration. But with a lot of H+ already, its ionization would be suppressed. Conversely, if there's excess OH-, then the solution would be basic, and the OH- would deprotonate the acetic acid, but since OH- is a strong base, maybe that would also affect the calculation.

Wait, let's take it step by step.

First, find the total moles of H+ and OH-:

Total H+ from HCl: 0.08 moles (since it's a strong acid).

Total OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18 moles.

So, when they neutralize, the reaction is H+ + OH- -> H2O.

The stoichiometry is 1:1. So, which one is in excess?

We have 0.08 moles H+ and 0.18 moles OH- initially.

If they react 1:1, then 0.08 moles H+ will neutralize 0.08 moles OH-, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles of OH- remaining.

But wait, but also the acetic acid is a source of H+ theoretically, right? But in the presence of a strong acid (HCl), it's unlikely that the acetic acid will dissociate. However, here it's possible that when HCl and Ba(OH)2 neutralize, perhaps the solution ends up with excess OH- or H+, and then the acetic acid can act accordingly.

But in this case, after neutralization, if OH- is in excess, but you also have acetic acid (which is a weak acid) present. The presence of OH- (a strong base) will deprotonate the acetic acid. Acetic acid has a pKa of around 4.76, so in a basic solution, the OH- will react with acetic acid to form acetate and water. So perhaps in this case, once we have excess OH-, they will react with the acetic acid. But how much?

So, first, neutralize H+ and OH-:

Available H+ from HCl: 0.08 mol

Available OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18 mol

After reaction: 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol OH- remaining. So, an excess of OH-.

But now we have 500 mL (0.5 L) of 0.1 M acetic acid, which is 0.05 mol of CH3COOH. The OH- in excess (0.10 mol) will react with the acetic acid:

OH- + CH3COOH → CH3COO- + H2O

So, the OH- is a strong base, so it will deprotonate the acetic acid completely. But how much acetic acid is present?

We have 0.05 moles of CH3COOH. The OH- in excess is 0.10 mol. So, the OH- is more than enough to neutralize all the acetic acid. Wait: the stoichiometry would be 1:1, since each OH- will take one H+ from acetic acid.

So, moles of OH-: 0.10

Moles of CH3COOH: 0.05

So, OH- will react with the 0.05 moles of CH3COOH first:

CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO- + H2O

So, after this reaction, the remaining OH- will be 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles. So, now we have excess OH- of 0.05 moles.

So now, the total solution volume is the sum of all the volumes: 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

So, the concentration of OH- is 0.05 moles / 1.2 L = 0.0417 M.

Thus, pOH = -log[OH-] = -log(0.0417) ≈ 1.38

Therefore, pH = 14 - 1.38 ≈ 12.62. Wait, but let me make sure I haven't skipped any steps here.

Wait, hold on. Let me break this down again.

First step: Find moles of H+ from HCl:
HCl is 0.2 M in 400 mL, so moles HCl = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles. Since HCl is strong acid, H+ is 0.08 moles.

Molar amount of Ba(OH)2 is 0.3 M in 300 mL, so moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so OH- is 2 * 0.09 = 0.18 moles.

So H+ from HCl and OH- from Ba(OH)2 react:

H+ + OH- → H2O

Initial: 0.08 H+ and 0.18 OH-
After reaction: 0 H+ (since 0.08 is less than 0.18) and 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles of OH- left.

Now, in the mixture, there are also 500 mL of 0.1 M acetic acid. So moles of CH3COOH = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 mol.

So now, the excess OH- will react with the acetic acid:

CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO- + H2O

Since OH- is 0.10 mol and CH3COOH is 0.05 mol, OH- is in excess here (0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol of OH- left). So, all of the acetic acid is neutralized into acetate ion, and there's 0.05 mol OH- remaining.

Now, the total volume is 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

So, the concentration of OH- is 0.05 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.0417 M.

pOH is calculated from that:

pOH = -log10(0.0417) ≈ 1.38

pH = 14 - pOH ≈ 14 - 1.38 = 12.62

Therefore, the pH of the solution is approximately 12.62.

Wait, but let me confirm that there aren't any other factors here. Because after neutralizing all the acetic acid, the solution has acetate ions (CH3COO-) and excess OH-. But acetate is a weak base, right? However, in the presence of excess OH- (strong base), the acetate ion won't significantly react because the strong base already makes the solution quite basic, so acetate's basicity is negligible. Therefore, the main contributor to the pH should indeed be the excess OH-.

Therefore, my calculation seems correct.

But just to go through each step again:

Step 1: Calculate moles of H+ and OH- from strong acid and base.

Step 2: Neutralize H+ and OH- to see which is in excess. Here, OH- is in excess by 0.10 mol.

Step 3: The remaining OH- (0.10 mol) reacts with the weak acid, which can donate H+; since OH- is a strong base, it will deprotonate the acetic acid until either all the acetic acid is consumed or all the OH- is consumed. In this case, since OH- is 0.10 mol and CH3COOH is 0.05 mol, OH- will consume 0.05 mol of CH3COOH to form 0.05 mol of CH3COO- (and water), leaving 0.05 mol of OH- remaining.

Step 4: Calculate the excess OH- concentration. Total volume 1.2 L, so [OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0417 M. Then pOH is log inverse, giving around 1.38, so pH ≈ 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

Therefore, the answer should be pH ≈ 12.6 or 12.62. Let me compute more precise values.

The concentration of OH- after all reactions: 0.05 mol / 1.2 L = 0.041666... M ≈ 0.04167 M.

The pOH is -log(0.04167). Let's compute that.

log(0.04167) = log(4.1667 x 10^-2) = log(4.1667) + (-2). log(4.1667) ≈ 0.6198. So log(0.04167) ≈ 0.6198 - 2 = -1.3802

Therefore, pOH = 1.3802, so pH = 14 - 1.3802 ≈ 12.6198.

So approximately 12.62. Rounding to two decimal places would be 12.62. But maybe appropriate to use two significant figures? Wait, let's check the significant figures.

The problem gives concentrations as 0.1 M, 0.2 M, 0.3 M, each with one decimal place, so two significant figures? Wait, 0.1 has one, 0.2 has one, 0.3 has one. The volumes: 500 mL (ambiguous, could be 3 significant figures, but if it's 500 without a decimal, maybe one or two?), 400 mL similar, 300 mL. But in general, in such problems, the given data usually determines sig figs. Since the concentrations are given as 0.1 (one), 0.2 (one), 0.3 (one). The volumes are ambiguous. If 500 mL is 5.0 x 10^2 mL with two sig figs, but maybe everyone uses 3 in mL. But maybe not, maybe 500 is considered one significant figure? This is a murky point.

However, since most of the numbers are given to one decimal place, but the answer is probably expected to two decimal places as it's pH. I think the answer would be about pH = 12.62. So, boxing that.

But wait, some sources might say that after neutralizing the strong acid and base, when reacting with acetic acid, there could be a buffer solution. Wait, but in this situation, is the solution a buffer or a strong base excess?

When OH- is in excess, even after neutralizing acetic acid, the acetate ion will be present, but excess OH- makes the solution strongly basic, which would overshadow any buffering effect. Hence, the pH is determined solely by the concentration of excess OH-.

Therefore, pH ~12.62.

Just to make sure, is there a common mistake here?

Potential mistake 1: Forgetting to double the moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2. Since each Ba(OH)2 releases 2 OH-, some may forget that and only take 0.09 mol instead of 0.18.

Mistake 2: Forgetting to consider the reaction between OH- and acetic acid. If someone just subtracts H+ from OH- and then uses only that to find pH, they would maybe calculate OH- excess of 0.10, leading to pOH of ≈1. So pH = 13, but that's incorrect because the OH- then reacts with the acetic acid, giving less OH- excess.

So that's why, in this problem, you can't ignore the reaction between OH- and the weak acid.

Another point to consider is when mixing solutions the volumes add up. Here, 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL, which is correct.

Therefore, all steps make sense and the calculations seem right.

**Final Answer**
The pH of the solution is \boxed{12.62}.
