# Original Question

We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.
So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes?

We need to determine the probability that a single atom will decay in the next 150 minutes given that it has not decayed in the first 50 minutes. The decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%, which suggests using an exponential distribution model due to the memoryless property of radioactive decay.

**Step 1: Determine the decay constant (λ)**
Given the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%:
\[
P(T \leq 100) = 1 - e^{-100\lambda} = 0.32
\]
Solving for λ:
\[
e^{-100\lambda} = 0.68 \implies -100\lambda = \ln(0.68) \implies \lambda = -\frac{\ln(0.68)}{100} \approx 0.003857 \, \text{per minute}
\]

**Step 2: Apply the memoryless property**
The memoryless property of the exponential distribution states that the remaining time until decay is independent of the time already passed. The probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is:
\[
P(T \leq 150) = 1 - e^{-150\lambda}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the probability**
Using the decay constant λ:
\[
150\lambda = 150 \times 0.003857 \approx 0.5785
\]
\[
e^{-0.5785} \approx 0.5608
\]
\[
P(T \leq 150) = 1 - 0.5608 = 0.4392 \approx 43.92\%
\]

**Conclusion**
The probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given it has not decayed in the first 50 minutes, is approximately 43.9%, which rounds to:

\boxed{44\%}

# R1 reasoning

Okay, so I need to figure out the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes. The original information is that there's a 32% probability of decay within 100 minutes. Hmm.

First, I remember that decay probabilities for atoms usually follow an exponential distribution, right? That's because radioactive decay is memoryless, meaning the probability of decaying in the next instant doesn't depend on how old the atom already is. If that's the case, then the probability of decay after a certain time can be modeled using the formula P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant.

But wait, in this problem, they don't mention the exponential distribution explicitly. They just say that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%. So maybe I need to use that information to find the decay constant λ first?

Given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (so 0.32), we can set up the equation:

0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ*100)

Let me solve for λ. Subtract 1 from both sides:

-0.68 = -e^(-λ*100)

Multiply both sides by -1:

0.68 = e^(-λ*100)

Take the natural logarithm of both sides:

ln(0.68) = -λ*100

So λ = -ln(0.68)/100.

Let me compute that. First, ln(0.68), using a calculator. Let's see, ln(0.68) ≈ ln(0.7) is about -0.3567, ln(0.6) is like -0.5108, so 0.68 is between them. Maybe more precise:

Using calculator steps, but since I don't have one here, I'll recall that ln(0.68) ≈ -0.38566. So:

λ = -(-0.38566)/100 = 0.38566/100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

Is that right? Let me check the calculation:

If P(100) = 1 - e^(-100λ) = 0.32

So e^(-100λ) = 0.68

Taking natural log:

-100λ = ln(0.68)

Thus λ = -ln(0.68)/100

Yes, that step is correct.

So with that λ, if the atom has already survived 50 minutes, the fact that it didn't decay in the first 50 minutes doesn't affect the probability for the next 150 minutes because of the memoryless property. But wait, is that correct? Wait, memoryless property says that the remaining time is exponential with the same parameter. So the probability that it decays in the next t minutes given it has survived s minutes is the same as the probability that a new atom decays in t minutes. Wait, but actually, in general, for an exponential distribution, the probability that it survives s + t minutes given that it has survived s minutes is equal to the probability it survives t minutes. So the decay probability in the next t minutes given survival up to time s is 1 - e^(-λt). So it doesn't depend on s.

But in this case, we want to know the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes, given that it didn't decay in the first 50 minutes.

So applying the memoryless property, this should just be the same as the probability it decays within 150 minutes from the start. Wait no:

Wait, if it already didn't decay for 50 minutes, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is the probability that it decays between t=50 and t=200.

But the original distribution says that at t=100, cumulative probability is 32%. So wait, maybe my initial assumption that it's exponential? Because if the decay happens with 32% probability within 100 minutes, if it's following an exponential distribution, then P(t <= 100) = 1 - e^(-100λ) = 0.32. But here, the question states that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes, which is probably not a general statement, but maybe another user-dependent consideration?

Alternatively, maybe they are considering the decay probability as in a fixed probability over time, like each minute it has a fixed chance to decay. But in reality, nuclear decay is considered to be exponential.

If we instead thought of it as a fixed probability per minute, then it might be different, but since the problem states the overall probability for 100 minutes is 32%, we might have to first model the decay process. So perhaps but even so to solve it.

Assuming it's exponential, which is the standard approach, then regardless of the time that's passed, the probability to decay in the next t minutes starting from now is 1 - e^(-λt). Since it's 150 minutes now, so 1 - e^(-λ*150). But we can calculate λ based on t=100 minutes: λ = -ln(0.68)/100 as before.

Wait, but that gives λ ≈ 0.0038566 per minute. Then using that, the probability for 150 minutes is 1 - e^(-0.0038566*150). Let me compute that:

0.0038566*150 ≈ 0.5785

Then e^(-0.5785) ≈ e^(-0.5) is ~0.6065, e^(-0.6) is ~0.5488, so 0.5785 is between 0.5 and 0.6. Let me approximate:

0.5785 is 0.5 + 0.0785. Let's compute e^(-0.5 -0.0785) = e^(-0.5) * e^(-0.0785) ≈ 0.6065 * 0.9245 ≈ 0.6065*0.9245.

Multiply 0.6065 * 0.9 = 0.54585, 0.6065*0.0245 = ~0.01486. So total ≈ 0.54585 + 0.01486 ≈ 0.5607. So e^(-0.5785) ≈ approx 0.5607. Therefore 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393 ≈ 43.93%.

But is the 150 minutes the total time from the original start or from the current time?

Wait, the problem states: 50 minutes have passed, starting from the creation of the atom, and it hasn't decayed. The question is, what is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. So from the current time (t=50) to t=200 (since 50 + 150 = 200). However, with an exponential distribution, since it's memoryless, the fact that it survived 50 minutes doesn't affect the next 150 minutes. Therefore, the probability would be the same as the probability for 150 minutes starting from a fresh atom: 1 - e^{-λ*150}. Wait, but in original problem, the probability of decaying within 100 minutes is 32%, which would mean that over 150 minutes...

Hold on. Wait, perhaps there's a mistake here. Because the existing knowledge is that the atom has a 32% chance to decay within 100 minutes. But maybe the problem isn't assuming the atom's decay is memoryless. If they had given the half-life, or if the decay rate was stated, but here they just gave an overall probability for the first 100 minutes. Perhaps the problem isn't necessarily exponential. But given that it's about atomic decay, it's safe to model as exponential. Let me check what happens if we proceed with that.

Alternatively, if they do not assume memoryless property, maybe they want to compute the conditional probability. If survival up to 50 minutes, then the probability of decay in next 150 minutes is [Probability decay between 50 and 200]/[Probability survive 50 minutes].

But in that case, we model the total time starting from 0. But we need to use the probability that decay occurs between 50 and 200 minutes, divided by the probability of surviving at least 50 minutes.

If original decay probability at 100 minutes is 32%, so P(T <=100) =0.32

Then, to calculate P(T <=200). But we aren't told anything about P(T <=200). So maybe that information is needed. However, in the exponential model, we could calculate P(T <=200) with the same λ.

Wait so, maybe it's supposed to be a conditional probability where if you model with an exponential distribution, the key would be:

Given that T > 50, find P(T <= 200 | T > 50). Which equals [P(T <=200) - P(T <=50)] / P(T >50 )

Assuming that we model P(T <=t ) =0.32 when t=100.

So using exponential model, first find λ:

0.32 =1 - e^{-100λ} as before, then λ= -ln(0.68)/100 ≈0.0038566

Compute P(T <=200) =1 - e^{-200λ}=1 - e^{-200*(0.0038566)}=1 - e^{-0.7713}

Compute e^{-0.7713}: 0.7713 is ln(2^2.22); Wait, e^{-0.7713} ≈ e^{-0.7} * e^{-0.0713} ≈ 0.4966 * 0.931 ≈0.4966*0.931 ≈0.462.

Therefore, 1 - 0.462 ≈0.538.

Similarly, compute P(T <=50) =1 - e^{-λ*50} =1 - e^{-0.0038566*50}≈1 -e^{-0.19283}≈1 -(approx 0.8247)=0.1753.

Therefore, numerator is P(50 < T <=200)=0.538 -0.1753=0.3627.

Denominator is P(T >50)=1 -0.1753=0.8247.

Therefore, the conditional probability is 0.3627 /0.8247 ≈ approx 0.4397 or approx 43.97%, which align with the 43.93% from before.

Wait, that matches the initial calculation. But actually in exponential, the memoryless property would state that P(T > t + s | T > s)= P( T > t ). So here, the survival probability for additional 150 minutes after surviving 50 minutes is the same as survival probability for 150 minutes. So e^{-λ*150}.

Therefore, decay probability is 1 - e^{-λ*150}. Which is exactly what we calculated both directly and through conditional probability. Got it.

So in both cases, the answer is ~43.93% ~44%

But let me test with numbers:

Given the decay probability in 100 minutes is 32%, so within 100 minutes, chance of decay 32% So lambda= -ln(1 -0.32)/100≈-ln(0.68)/100≈0.385662/100≈0.003856 per minute.

Then probability to decay between 50 and 200 is P(T <=200) - P(T <=50) = [1 - e^{-0.003856*200}] - [1 - e^{-0.003856*50} ]= e^{-0.003856*50} - e^{-0.003856*200}≈e^{-0.1928} -e^{-0.7712}≈0.8247 -0.4624≈0.3623

Then dividing by P(T >50)= e^{-0.003856*50}=0.8247,

So 0.3623 /0.8247≈0.439 ≈43.9%.

Alternatively, the memoryless property says P(T >50 +150 | T >50)=P(T >150), so decay probability is 1 - e^{-0.003856*150}≈1 -e^{-0.578}=1 -0.561≈0.439.

Either method gives ~43.9%. So even if you compute the entire span of 200 minutes, partitioned into the first 50 and the next 150, when conditional probability makes focusing on 150 because survival of the first 50.

Therefore, the answer is approximately 43.9%, so rounding perhaps 44%.

But to get the precise number:

Compute λ = - ln(0.68)/100.

ln(0.68) is:

Let me use calculator input:

ln(0.68) ≈ -0.38566248.

Therefore, λ = 0.38566248 /100 ≈0.0038566248 per minute.

Then over 150 minutes, λ t =0.0038566248*150≈0.5784937.

Compute e^{-0.5784937}.

First, compute 0.5784937. Let's note that e^{-0.5} ≈0.6065, and e^(-0.5784937 ) = e^(-0.5 -0.0784937 )= e^{-0.5} * e^{-0.0784937}.

e^{-0.0784937} ≈1 -0.0784937 + (0.0784937^2)/2 - ...

First order approx: 1 -0.0785 =0.9215. Second order: 1 -0.0785 + 0.00308 ≈0.9246. The actual value is around e^-0.0785≈0.9245.

Therefore, e^-0.5784937 ≈0.6065 *0.9245 ≈0.5606.

Thus, 1 -0.5606≈0.4394≈43.94%.

So approximately 43.94%. So about 44% as the probability.

But the problem says "the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes". So if we use their exact numbers, perhaps they expect to use a uniform distribution instead of exponential. Hmm. Wait, but typically, decay is exponential, but to clarify, if the problem did not specify the process, but gave only that, maybe another approach?

Alternatively, a student might see this and think of it as: there's a 32% chance to decay within 100 minutes. Therefore, assuming that perhaps a uniform probability over those 100 minutes. So, for example, if the probability is uniform, then the probability density is constant. So that the probability of decay at any moment is the same. So integrating from t=0 to t=100, the cumulative is 32%. Thus, constant hazard rate? But even this would lead to an increasing survival function...

Wait, no. If the decay is uniform over 100 minutes, survival function S(t) for t<=100 would be 1 - 0.32*(t/100).

But in such a case, at t=0, S(0)=1, at t=100, S(100)=1 -0.32=0.68. But in exponential decay, the survival is exp(-λ t), which is different.

If instead, S(t) is linear from 1 to 0.68 over 100 minutes, which is a uniform distribution. So the probability density function f(t)= -dS/dt =0.32/100=0.0032 per minute from t=0 to 100, and zero after. However, in reality, after t=100, if the model is uniform strictly between 0 and100, but the problem here mentions "probability to decay within 100 minutes is 32%" but does not specify past 100 minutes.  However, since the event is "decay in the next 150 minutes," which would include times beyond the original 100. But wait, in this model, if we take that until t=100, the decay probability is 32%, but after that, what's the cumulative probability? If the pdf is zero beyond 100 minutes (i.e., after t=100, once the 100 minutes are up, the atom can no longer decay because it's only allowed to decay within 100 minutes). But that would be a truncated distribution. However, real decay processes don't work like that, as they can decay at any time. Hence, exponential is a better model.

But if the problem was presented without referring to physics, just probability, maybe we can model with uniform. Then probabilities beyond 100 minutes could be either zero or not considered. However, given that in the question there's talk of the next 150 minutes, which would go beyond 100 minutes from the start (so total time would be 50 +150=200 minutes). But in the 100 minutes decay model, no probability after that if uniform.

But that would create issues in the conditional probability. Let's think through differently.

If we consider that the original decay only can happen in the first 100 minutes, with 32% chance uniformly distributed. Let's clarify:

If between t=0 and t=100, there is 32% chance of decay. So it would be, in probability terms, we can model the decay time T as a uniform distribution between 0 and100 minutes, with P(T ≤100)=0.32. Wait, but if T is uniform over [0,100], then P(T ≤100)=1, which contradicts. So this seems inconsistent.

Alternatively, the decay happens with 32% chance at some point in 100 minutes, but with the time being uniformly likely over those 100 minutes. So then the cdf is F(t)=0.32*(t/100) for 0≤t≤100, and F(t)=0.32 for t>100. Thus, atom has 0.32 probability to decay within 100 mins, but if it decays, the decay time is uniform between0 and100.

But in this model, the survival function S(t)=1-F(t).

So given that the atom hasn't decayed in first50 minutes, what’s the probability that it decays in the next150 mins (so by t=200).

First, conditional probability:

The atom hasn't decayed in 50 minutes, so T>50. In this model, the probability that T>50 is:

1 - F(50) =1 -0.32*(50/100)= 1 -0.16=0.84.

But also, since after t=100, F(t) stays at0.32, so P(T>100)=1 -0.32=0.68.

But wait, if T is uniformly distributed in [0,100] with probability 0.32, and there's0.68 probability that T= infinity(doesn't decay). Wait, no: that would model that the atom has 32% chance to decay in uniform time between0 and100, and 68% chance not to decay at all. But if that's the case, then the decay time is a mixed distribution: With probability0.32, T is uniform on(0,100), and with0.68, T= infinity. Then the cdf F(t)=0.32*(min(t,100)/100) for t≥0.

Wait, if that's the case, then the survival function S(t)=1 -0.32*(t/100) for t<100, and S(100)=0.68, and after 100, S(t)=0.68.

But then the question is, given T >50, what's the probability that T<=200 (it decays within 200).

But in reality, here T is either in [0,100] or infinity. So if after 100 minutes, whether the atom hasn't decayed, it never decays.

Therefore, given that T>50, possible outcomes are T is in (50,100] with probability F(100) - F(50) =0.32 -0.16=0.16 or T= infinity (never decays) remains with0.68.

Therefore, P(T<=200 | T>50)= [P(50 < T <=200)] / P(T>50)

Since when conditioning on T>50, and decay after 50 can only occur between50 and100 minutes, and after 100 minutes, decaying doesn't happen.

Anyway, in this model, T cannot decay after 100. So arriving at t=50, if you ask what's probability to decay in next150 mins (i.e., up to t=200) then in this model, the answer is P(50 < T ≤100 | T>50) = [P(T≤100) - P(T<=50)] / P(T>50) = (0.32 -0.16)/0.84 =0.16 /0.84 ≈0.1905≈19.05%.

But this doesn't match the original problem's assumption, since a decaying atom can't spontaneously not decay. So in real physics, the atom will decay eventually, which is consistent with the decay processes. So that model of uniform decay with a fat tail of non-decay is incorrect for physics. Therefore, the appropriate model is still the exponential distribution.

Therefore, the original approach of 43.9% is more viable.

But the problem didn't specify the model. So this is ambiguous.

But if this is a math probability quiz question, perhaps they wanted an answer not depending on physical knowledge. If you don't know the memoryless property, assume that the decay has a constant probability per unit time; but as per common problems, I think maybe it's an exponential assumption. Alternatively, treating the problem with the discrete-time.

Alternatively, perhaps it's using the conditional probability. If you have 32% chance in 100 minutes, and constrained the first50 minutes no decay, but so per minute probability, but without memoryless, but models with memory which is non-physical.

Wait, but perhaps an even simpler approach would be to consider the conditional probability:

If sometimes you have something like, Probability(A|B) = Probability(A∩B)/Probability(B). So, The probability that it decays in the next150mins given that it didn't decay in 50mins.

But if the total experiment was 200 minutes. The initial parameters were that in 100 minutes, 32% decay. But without assuming exponential, how would you extrapolate?

Alternatively, this is a quantum mechanics question, since beta decay...Though the problem says "atom (atomic nucleus)", so unless the decay is treated in quantum mechanics terms (as in tunneling, with a half-life). Then the natural process being memoryless.

Alternatively, the problem is likely expecting exponential. Thus, applying the memoryless property, lambda as computed. So after 50 minutes, the remaining time is Exponential with same lambda, so the prob of decaying within next 150minutes is1 - e^{-lambda t} at lambda=0.003856, t=150 mins ≈43.9%.

Alternatively, check if the approach by converting into half-life. If T_1/2 is the half life, then l = ln(2)/T_half.

But perhaps the answer 43.9%.

But what if we think in terms of the original probability 32% in 100 minutes.

So the way to find probability that it decays in next150 minutes given it hasn't decayed in 50 minutes will require integrating from 50 to200 mins, but without a model. But as we don't know the distribution, but given it's an atom, likely deserves to assume exponential which results in Probability =1 - e^{-l*150}.

But how's that linked to the original 32%:

Since 1 - e^{-100 l}=0.32 .  Therefore, e^{-100l}=0.68.

Therefore, to compute1 - e^{-150*l}=1 - (e^{-100 l})^(150/100)=1 - (0.68)^(1.5)= ?

Primary interest in e^{-150*l }= ( e^{-100 l} )^(1.5) )=0.68^1.5≈ calculate. Let's compute that:

0.68 squared is 0.4624. Square root of 0.68 is approx0.8246. So then 0.68 * sqrt{0.68}≈0.68*0.8246≈0.5607. Therefore, e^{-150*λ}=≈0.5607; hence, P=1 -0.5607=0.4393≅43.93%.

So same result.

Alternatively, not even distinguishing lambda, just re-exponentiating, since the survival probability at time s is (survival for 100min)^(s/100). Because if the decay is exponential, S(t) = e^(-l t)= (e^(-l*100))^(t/100))= (0.68)^(t/100). Therefore, survival probability:

S(50)=0.68^(0.5)=sqrt(0.68)≈0.8245.

Then, survival for 200 minutes: S(200)=0.68^(2)=0.4624.

So the decay probability up to 200 is1 -0.4624 =0.5376.

Thus, decay from50 to200 is0.5376 - (1 -0.8245)=0.5376 -0.1755≅0.3621.

Conditional probability is0.3621 /0.8245≈0.439≈43.9%.

Either way, the answer ends up as ~43.9%. Which rounds to \boxed{44\%}。
