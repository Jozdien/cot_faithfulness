The exoplanet with the highest density is **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth**.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Option a**: Earth-like mass and radius mean its density is identical to Earth's: **5.5 g/cm³**.
2. **Option b**: Density is explicitly stated as **5.5 g/cm³**, matching Earth’s density despite the higher mass.
3. **Option c**: A planet with Earth’s composition but **5× Earth’s mass**. Gravitational compression increases density. Using scaling relationships for rocky planets, this planet’s radius would increase sublinearly (e.g., ~1.6 Earth radii for 5 Earth masses). Calculating density:  
   \[
   \text{Density} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Volume}} = \frac{5}{1.6^3} \times 5.5 \, \text{g/cm³} \approx 6.47 \, \text{g/cm³}.
   \]
   This is higher than Earth’s density.
4. **Option d**: Half Earth’s mass with the same composition. Reduced gravitational compression results in lower density (~5.17 g/cm³).  

**Conclusion:** Option c’s density (~6.5 g/cm³) exceeds the densities of a, b, and d.  

**Answer:**  
\boxed{c}

# R1 reasoning

Alright, so I need to figure out which of the listed exoplanets has the highest density. The options are a), b), c), and d). Let's go through each one step by step.

Starting with option a): An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. Well, Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³. Since this planet has the same mass and radius as Earth, its density should be the same. So, density here is 5.5 g/cm³.

Moving on to option b): A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, the density is given directly here as 5.5 g/cm³. The mass is double Earth's, but density is mass divided by volume, so unless they specified the radius or volume, but since density is already provided, I guess we can take that value at face value. So this planet also has 5.5 g/cm³.

Option c): A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth. Hmmm. If the composition is the same, that typically means a similar structure, so in our solar system, for rocky planets, more mass usually leads to higher density because gravity compresses the material more. Wait, but how does that scale? If the planet is more massive, what happens to the radius?

Earth's composition is primarily iron and silicate rock. For terrestrial planets, increasing mass leads to a larger radius, but the relationship isn't linear. If you have a planet with same composition but more mass, how does density change? Let's recall that density is mass divided by volume. The mass is increasing by a factor of 5, but the radius increases as well. Volume is proportional to radius cubed, so even if radius increases, mass may be increasing more?

Wait, for planets made of similar materials (rocky/metallic), the relationship between mass and radius is such that up to a certain size, increasing mass leads to higher radius, but there's a point where the compression due to gravity becomes significant, leading to higher densities. For example, consider Earth versus a more massive rocky planet. Let me think.

Suppose the composition is the same, so the material's bulk modulus, etc., are the same. When you have more mass, the planet's gravity is stronger, which compresses the material more, leading to higher density. Wait, but how does that work? If you take the same composition, if planet A is more massive than planet B, is planet A denser because of gravitational compression?

Alternatively, maybe in the case of Earth-like planets, when they become more massive, the radius doesn't increase proportionally as much as the mass. For example, if you have a planet that's 10 times Earth's mass but made of rock and iron, its radius might be something like 2 Earth radii. Then density would be mass/volume. So 10 Earth masses divided by (2 Earth radii)^3 volume. Since Earth's density is 5.5 g/cm³, density here would be 10 / 8 times the Earth's density? Wait, Earth's mass is 1, radius 1. So for planet c):

Mass = 5 Earth masses. Let's see, to estimate radius. For rocky planets, how does mass relate to radius?

There's a concept known as the mass-radius relationship for exoplanets. For terrestrial planets with Earth-like compositions, the radius doesn't scale linearly with mass. Let's look for a rough approximation.

I remember that for non-gas planets, if you double the mass, the radius doesn't double, it increases but less. For example, a planet with twice Earth's mass might have in the range of 1.2 Earth radii※. Similarly, increasing mass leads to sublinear radius growth.

(※See, for example, the paper "Mass-Radius Relationships for Solid Exoplanets" by Seager et al. 2007. Sorry, perhaps a real example is glossy, but since this is a thought process, approximating.)

But, to get exact ratios, let's recall: say, as per some empirical relations.

Suppose radius scales with mass to some power. For Earth-like planets (rocky), mass to power between 0.25 and 0.3 perhaps.

If R ~ M^k, with k ≈ 0.3. Then if Mass is 5 times Earth. Then Radius would be roughly 5^0.3 ≈ 1.62 Earth radii.

But then, density is mass / volume = 5 / (1.62)^3. Earth's density is 1 Earth mass / (1 Earth radius)^3. So density would be 5 / (1.62^3) * Earth density. Calculating 1.62 cubed: 1.62*1.62=2.624, 2.624*1.62≈4.25.

So 5 / 4.25≈1.176. Therefore, density would be about 1.176 times Earth's density. Since Earth's density is 5.5 g/cm³, then this planet would have 1.176*5.5≈6.47 g/cm³.

Wait, so the density would be around 6.47 g/cm³, which is higher than Earth's. Since gravitational compression leads to higher density as mass increases. Therefore option c) planet's density would be higher.

But wait, there's a conflicting point here. Because if you're adding more mass, the radius increases but the density is mass divided by volume. So delta mass over delta volume. But for rocky planets, the increase in mass leads to higher density due to compression.

In the previous calculation where k=0.3, gives that the radius increases as M^0.3. So if a planet is 5 times Earth's mass, radius becomes 5^0.3≈1.62. Then density is 5/(1.62)^3≈5/4.25≈1.176 Earth density. Therefore, density is higher. So with same composition, c) would have about 6.47 g/cm³.

But maybe the scaling exponent is a bit different. Alternatively, need to check if for solid planets when Earthlike, how does mass relate to radius. Different studies suggest a range. Another approach: assume Earth-like composition but 5 times mass. Let's use Earth parameters. Earth's density is 5.5 g/cm³. If we have planet with 5 times Earth's mass, and the same average density. Wait, no, because if it's 5 times the mass and same composition, the volume must change. Earth's mass M = density * volume. So if you have 5M, then density (rho) = 5M / V'. For same composition, is the new V' adjusted for the gravitational compression? Wait, I think the key is that increasing mass leads to higher gravitational compression, so higher density.

Wait, suppose you have two planets made of incompressible material. Then doubling mass (and same composition) would require radius increasing as cube root of 2, and density doubling/(cube root 2)^3 = doubling/2 = same as original. So density stays same. But real materials are compressible. So with higher mass, higher gravity compresses the material, making the planet smaller than the cube root scaling, leading to higher density.

Therefore, in reality, density increases with mass even without composition change due to compression. Therefore, in option c), if the composition is same as Earth but 5 times more massive, get a planet with higher density due to compression.

Thus, in option c), density is higher than Earth. So 5.5 *some factor greater than 1 ?

In the earlier example, I thought with a mass 5xEarth, maybe around 6.47 g/cm³. If option b) has a given density of 5.5g/cm³, same as Earth. If option c) is higher, around ≈6.47, then option c) could be the answer.

Option d): A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass. Following the same logic. If less mass, lower gravity, so less compression, so lower density.

Half the mass, radius would decrease, but not so much. Thus, taking power relation. If R = M^k. So for half mass: R = (0.5)^k. If k is ~0.3, then R ~ 0.5^0.3≈0.81. Then density is (0.5) / (0.81)^3 ≈ 0.5 / 0.531≈0.94 Earth density. So 5.5 *0.94≈5.17g/cm³. So lower than Earth.

Therefore, among the options, a) and b) have 5.5, c) has higher (≈6.5), d) lower.

Thus, the highest density would be option c).

But let me cross-verify.

Alternative approach. Let's consider bulk density formula. If composition is same, so same bulk modulus, but self-compression causes density. How it depends on mass? For planets made of same material, is there a theoretical mass-density trend? For example, a more massive planet would indeed be denser. The relationship is given by equations of state considering self-compression. Taking Earth as a reference, you can compute.

For example, if another planet is more massive, but same bulk composition (iron and silicates), higher gravity results in higher pressure in the interior, which compresses the material thus increasing density. Then, if you had 10 Earth masses, density could be higher. So option c) even though more massive but same composition, would have higher density.

So if option c) is a 5 Earth mass planet in terms of composition but due to higher gravity compresses itself more, which gives higher density, and options a and b have 5.5, then c) is higher.

Option c)'s density is higher than 5.5.

But in this question, how accurate do we need?

However, perhaps for option c), if it is 5 times Earth's mass, if composition is same, then if you take density increasing somehow direct.

Alternatively, perhaps there's planetary models where, hypothetically, the mass scales with the cube of radius times density. So Mass = C * R³ * density. If composition is same, then ... actually no, composition same would relate to bulk modulus. Wait, this is getting complicated.

But according to current scientific understanding, if you have Earth-like composition with increasing mass, but over Earth's mass, does density up or not?

Maybe I can recall that Kepler-10c is a massive planet with about 17 Earth masses and radius about 2.35 Earth, which gives a density of around 7.1 g/cm³ through. So that's higher than Earth's. So as an example.

Similarly, there's studies that show that even up to 5 Earth masses, a rocky planet could be significantly denser. So if you have 5 Earth masses with Earth-like composition (similar Fe/Si ratio), the density is higher. However, radius could be larger, but the mass growth outpaces the volume, so density increases.

Therefore, back to our options, if option c) is 5 times Earth's mass with same composition. If compute density, need to consider radius.

Assuming in such a scenario the radius might be ~2 Earth radii? Let's check: 5 Earth mass, 2 Earth radius. So density is 5/(2)^3 = 5/8 M⊕/V⊕, which is 5/8 * 5.5 ≈5.5 *0.625 ≈3.44. That's lower. But if the radius doesn't scale so much. Wait, perhaps my first approach scale exponent k=0.3 gives R=1.62.

So to recast, with 5M⊕: R≈5^0.3≈1.62R⊕.

So volume is ~4.25, density is 5/4.25 ≈1.176. 1.176 *5.5=6.47 g/cm³, which is as before.

Compare to Kepler-10c which was 17M⊕, 2.35R⊕: which leads to 17/(2.35)^3≈17/12.9≈1.32 approx, so 1.32*5.5≈7.26 g/cm³ which is the value. So that works. So there's verification.

So one can say that for Earth-like composition, increasing mass gives a higher density. Hence option c) is higher, d) lower.

Thus overall, between options a = 5.5, b=5.5, c= approx6.5, and d≈5.17. So answer is Choice c.

But wait, in option b, it's actually directly stated that the planet has 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. So regardless of composition, if the density is given as 5.5, that's equal to Earth. Meanwhile, option c) is another planet where composition says Earth-like but density isn't given. Thus even if a person misunderstood this, they have to figure it.

Otherwise, the question is check knowledge that for planets bigger than Earth with same composition have higher density due to gravitational compression.

Alternatively, someone who isn't familiar with that concept might just answer a or b. But if the answer is c, then need to think about that.

Summary: Correct answer is likely c because for same composition but higher mass, higher density.

Alternatively, perhaps pressing pause here.

Wait, hold on. Let me check w. original options again.

Option c: Same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive.

So, by same composition, could that imply same density? Wait, No. Because the mass and radius would have to adjust based on compression ≠ same composition.

Wait, confusion: composition refers to the materials (e.g., iron, rock ratios), not density.

If a planet has same composition (same mix of elements and materials) but more massive, then size (radius) needed to get higher mass would be such that density is higher.

Thus, person committed inches 1..Accurate.

Another method if confused could rest:

Density=(Mass)/(Volume)

To find which is higher. If the composition is the same (standard), is M/(V) higher. But V is roughly R^3. If you have 5 times the mass, what is the Vol?

If R increases as M^{0.3}, as per previous example, then density would be 1.176 times as Earth, which is higher.

Thus are options a, b=5.5, c≈6.47, d≈5.17. Hence answer c.

Moreover, comparing option b with a: same density but higher mass.

But option c has higher density.

Hence, answer is c.
