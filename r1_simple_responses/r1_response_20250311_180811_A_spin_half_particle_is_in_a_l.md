To find the expectation value of the operator \(10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x\) for a spin-half particle in the state \(0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle\), we first recognize that the expectation value of a linear combination of operators is the linear combination of the expectation values. 

The given state is normalized as it satisfies:
\[
(0.5)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = 0.25 + 0.75 = 1
\]

For \(\sigma_z\), the expectation value is calculated as:
\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = |0.5|^2 \cdot 1 + \left|\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right|^2 \cdot (-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5
\]
Multiplying by 10 gives:
\[
10 \langle \sigma_z \rangle = 10 \cdot (-0.5) = -5
\]

For \(\sigma_x\), the expectation value is calculated using the matrix form of \(\sigma_x\) and the state vector:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 & \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix} = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]
Multiplying by 5 gives:
\[
5 \langle \sigma_x \rangle = 5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 5 \cdot 0.866 = 4.33
\]

Adding these results together:
\[
10 \langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5 \langle \sigma_x \rangle = -5 + 4.33 \approx -0.67
\]

Rounded to one decimal place, the expectation value is:
\[
\boxed{-0.7}
\]

# R1 reasoning

Okay, let's see. We need to find the expectation value of the operator 10σ_z + 5σ_x for a spin-half particle in the state 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩. Hmm. 

First, I remember that the expectation value of an operator is calculated as the conjugate transpose of the state vector multiplied by the operator matrix multiplied by the state vector itself. So if the state is a superposition, like here, I need to express it as a vector, then compute <ψ|A|ψ>, where A is the operator. 

The Pauli matrices σ_z and σ_x are known. Let me recall their matrix forms. σ_z is diagonal with entries 1 and -1. So σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. And σ_x is off-diagonal with 1s on the off-diagonal, so σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]]. Right. Then the operator here is 10σ_z + 5σ_x, which would be the matrix 10 times σ_z plus 5 times σ_x. So let's compute that.

But before forming the entire matrix, maybe it's easier to compute the expectation values of σ_z and σ_x separately and then multiply by 10 and 5 respectively, then add them. That might be simpler. I think expectation is linear, so <10σ_z + 5σ_x> = 10<σ_z> + 5<σ_x>. Yeah, that should work.

Okay, so first compute <σ_z>. The state is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩. Let me write that as a vector. Assuming |↑⟩ is [1;0] and |↓⟩ is [0;1]. Then the vector is [0.5; (√3)/2]. Let's compute the norm to check if it's normalized. (0.5)^2 + ( (√3)/2 )^2 = 0.25 + (3/4) = 1. Okay, so the state is normalized. Good.

The expectation value of σ_z is then the probability of |↑⟩ minus the probability of |↓⟩. Since σ_z is diagonal with eigenvalues +1 and -1. So <σ_z> = |0.5|^2*(1) + |(√3)/2|^2*(-1). Which is 0.25*1 + 0.75*(-1). That's 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. Right? So 10 times that would be -5. Okay.

Now <σ_x>. For σ_x, being off-diagonal, the expectation value is something you get from the off-diagonal elements. I recall that <σ_x> is equal to ψ† * σ_x * ψ. Let's compute that. Given the vector [0.5; (√3)/2], its conjugate transpose is [0.5, (√3)/2], since those are real numbers. Multiply by σ_x: [0.5, (√3)/2] * [[0,1],[1,0]] * [0.5; (√3)/2]. But since we're doing ψ† σ_x ψ, that's the same as [0.5, (√3)/2] multiplied by [ (σ_x * ψ) ]. 

Calculating σ_x * ψ: σ_x flips the components, so it would be [ (√3)/2, 0.5 ]^T. Then the inner product of [0.5, (√3)/2] with [ (√3)/2, 0.5 ] is 0.5*(√3)/2 + (√3)/2 * 0.5. So both terms are equal: (0.5*√3)/2 + (0.5*√3)/2 = (0.5*√3)/2 * 2 = 0.5*√3. So (0.5*√3) is equal to (sqrt(3)/2). Because 0.5 is 1/2. Therefore, <σ_x> = (sqrt(3)/2). So 5 times that is 5*(sqrt(3)/2). 

Therefore, the total expectation is 10<σ_z> + 5<σ_x> = (-5) + (5*sqrt(3)/2). Let's compute that numerically. sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732. So 5*1.732/2 = (5*0.866) ≈4.33. Then, -5 + 4.33 = -0.67. So approx -0.7. But hold on, to one decimal place. So -0.7 is -0.7. 

But let me double-check the calculations to avoid mistakes. Let's re-examine.

First, <σ_z> = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5, yes. Multiply by 10, that's -5. Then for <σ_x>, the product was sqrt(3)/2, so 5*(sqrt(3)/2). Let me calculate that more precisely. Take sqrt(3) ≈ 1.73205. So 1.73205 / 2 = 0.866025. Multiply by 5: 5 * 0.866025 ≈4.330125. Then the total expectation -5 + 4.330125 ≈-0.669875. Rounded to one decimal place is -0.7. So that should be the answer.

Alternatively, maybe compute <10σ_z + 5σ_x> directly by matrix multiplication. Let's see.

The operator 10σ_z +5σ_x is:

10*[[1,0],[0,-1]] +5*[[0,1],[1,0]] = [[10,5],[5,-10]]. 

Then the matrix is:

First row: [10,5]

Second row: [5,-10]

Now, the vector is [0.5; (√3)/2]. Let's compute [0.5 (√3)/2 ] * matrix * [0.5; (√3)/2 ]

Wait. The expectation value is the conjugate transpose times the matrix times the vector. 

But actually in components:

For a vector ψ = [a; b], <ψ|A|ψ> is [a*, b*] * A * [a; b]. So let's substitute numerical values. 

a = 0.5, b = sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.8660. So a* = 0.5, b* = sqrt(3)/2.

A is the matrix [[10,5],[5,-10]].

So [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] * [[10,5],[5,-10]] * [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]. Let me compute this step by step.

First, compute the matrix multiplication of the operator matrix with the vector: 

First component: 10*0.5 +5*(sqrt(3)/2) = 5 + (5*sqrt(3))/2 ≈5 +4.3301≈9.3301

Second component:5*0.5 + (-10)*(sqrt(3)/2) =2.5 -5*sqrt(3)≈2.5 -8.6603≈-6.1603

Then take the inner product with the conjugate (same as original here, since components are real): 

0.5*9.3301 + (sqrt(3)/2)*(-6.1603) ≈0.5*9.3301≈4.66505. And (sqrt(3)/2)*(-6.1603) ≈0.8660*(-6.1603)≈-5.3345.

Add them together: 4.66505 -5.3345≈-0.66945≈-0.7 as before. So it's correct. To one decimal, correct. So the answer is -0.7.

Wait, but the question says 'up to one decimal place'. So present -0.669... as -0.7. Yes. Thus boxed, \boxed{-0.7}

**Final Answer**
The expectation value is \boxed{-0.7}.
