To determine the number of optically active compounds, we analyze each structure for chirality, considering chiral centers, stereogenic axes, or planes of symmetry:

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**  
   The double bond's substituents (Cl and CH₃) are arranged in a Z configuration. However, the molecule lacks a stereogenic center or axis, as the substituents on the double bond do not induce chirality. **Not optically active.**

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**  
   This bicyclic compound has multiple specified stereocenters (3aR, 7aS) and an E-configured chloromethylene group. The complex structure lacks symmetry, making it chiral. **Optically active.**

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   The (2R,3S) configuration creates a plane of symmetry between the two methyl-bearing carbons, forming a meso compound. **Not optically active.**

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   The (2R,3R) configuration lacks a plane of symmetry, resulting in a chiral molecule. **Optically active.**

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**  
   The cyclopentyl alcohol’s C1 (bearing the -OH) has four distinct substituents (including the asymmetric ring environment due to the double bond), confirmed by the (R) designation. **Optically active.**

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**  
   The symmetric substitution pattern (1,3,5-triol with identical configurations) creates a plane of symmetry, rendering the molecule meso. **Not optically active.**

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**  
   The carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (C2) has four distinct substituents (cyclopentyl, CH₃, CH₂CH₃, and H), forming a chiral center. **Optically active.**

**Total optically active compounds: 4**  
(Compounds 2, 4, 5, and 7)

**Answer:** \boxed{4}

# R1 reasoning

Alright, so I need to figure out how many of these compounds are optically active. Remember, optical activity is when a compound can rotate plane-polarized light, which happens if the compound has a chiral center or some kind of chirality without a plane of symmetry. Chiral centers are usually carbon atoms bonded to four different groups. But there are other types of chirality like allenes, certain rings, or even some alkenes if they're part of a chiral structure. Let me go through each compound one by one.

First compound: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene.

The structure here is a substituted alkene. Let me draw it mentally. The double bond is between C1 and C2. At C1, there's a chlorine, then a double bond to C2, which has a methyl group (CH3), and the rest. The formula is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but but-1-ene would be four carbons. Let me see: 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, but substituted. At position 1, the CH2 is replaced with Cl and a methyl on the adjacent carbon. The structure would look like Cl-C(CH3)=CHCH2? Hmm, not sure. Let me clarify. For but-1-ene, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. If we put a chlorine on C1 and a methyl on C2, the structure would be Cl-C(CH3)=CHCH3. Wait, position 1 is where the Cl is attached? Wait, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So replacing the first carbon (the CH2 with the double bond): C1 is CHCl, because chlorine is at position 1. Then position 2 is CH(CH3). So structure: Cl-C(CH3)=CH2CH3? Wait, but but-1-ene has four carbons total, so the structure would be Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2? No, wait. Maybe actually:

1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be:

Carbon 1: Cl
Carbon 2: CH(CH3)
Then double bond between 1 and 2, then the rest. So it's Cl-CH(CH3)=CH2. Wait, that would be three carbons after the first? No, maybe:

Wait butane is four carbons. But but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. If it's 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, then the substituents are on carbons 1 and 2. So the structure would be Cl-C(CH3)=CH-CH3? But that makes the double bond between C1 and C2, then substituents Cl on C1 and CH3 on C2. That would give C1: Cl, C(CH3), and double bond. So C1 is bonded to Cl, a double bond, and two carbons (C(CH3) and maybe a CH2 group)?

Wait, maybe it's better to just draw the structure properly. Let me write the full name. The parent chain is but-1-ene. So positions 1 and 2 are double-bonded. The substituents are at 1 (chloro) and 2 (methyl). So the structure would be:

Cl  
|  
C=CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3

Wait, no. Let me number the chain from left to right. The but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So substituting a Cl on C1 (the first carbon, which is part of the double bond) and a methyl on C2. Therefore, the structure would be CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but that would be a different chain. Maybe:

Cl is on C1 (the CH2 group?), but with the double bond starting at C1. Wait, perhaps the correct structure is Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2? But that doesn't include the double bond. Hmm. I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The compound is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. The "but-1-ene" tells me that the double bond is between C1 and C2. The substituents are chloro on C1 and methyl on C2. So the structure is:

C1 (with Cl), double bond to C2 (with methyl group), then C3 and C4. Since it's but-1-ene, the remaining two carbons (C3 and C4) must be CH2 and CH3. To sum up, the structure would be Cl-C(CH3)=CHCH3. Wait, but but-1-ene has four carbons. Cl on C1 (double bond start) and methyl on C2. So C1: Cl, C2: methyl, double bond between them. Then the other two carbons on C2 would be two more CH3 groups? That can’t be correct. Wait, maybe I've got the structure wrong. Alternatively, chloro on C1 (double bond to C2), which also has a methyl. Then, the remaining part is just two carbons. Wait, but the parent chain must be four carbons. Let me try writing the skeleton:

Positions: 1----2----3----4

But with a double bond between 1 and 2.

So, for 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene:

At C1: Cl attached.
At C2: CH3 attached.
But because of the double bond between 1 and 2, the actual groups around the double bond are:

C1: Cl, CH2 (since it's butane, maybe the rest is CH2CH2?), but I'm getting stuck. Maybe looking for stereoisomerism here. The compound is designated as Z. For a double bond to have Z configuration, the higher priority groups on each carbon are on the same side. But for optical activity, it's not the double bond's geometry that matters directly, but whether the molecule is chiral. 

Now, does this molecule have a chiral center? Let's see. Looking at the possible chiral centers. If there's a carbon with four different groups. Let me try to figure out the structure again. Let's assume the structure is Cl-C(CH3)=CHCH2. Wait, that's five carbons? That doesn't make sense. Wait, but but-1-ene is four carbons. Let me specify:

Carbon 1: Cl and double bond to C2.

Carbon 2: CH3, double bond to C1, and connected to C3 and C4. Wait, but C3 is next. So C2 is connected to C1 (double bonded), C3, and a methyl. Then C3 is connected to C2 and C4. So the structure would be: Cl-C(CH3)=CH-CH2. However, then we have four carbons. Maybe it's Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. That would be three carbons, which isn't butane. Wait, maybe the confusion comes from the substituents. Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. That would be buta-1-ene but substituted with Cl on C1 and methyl on C2. Wait, but buta-1-ene would be CH2=CHCH2CH3. If we substitute Cl on C1: making it CHCl=CHCH2CH3? But also a methyl on C2: Wait the original C2 in but-1-ene is CH2 (from CH2=CHCH2CH3). If we put a methyl on C2, then C2 becomes CH(CH3). So the structure would be CHCl-C(CH3)=CHCH3? Then this would be:

Cl on C1, which is double bonded to C2 (which has a methyl group), and then C3 is CH and C4 is CH3? Wait, this is getting too tangled. Let me try to write the SMILES notation. For but-1-ene, it's C=C-C-C. If it's 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, then Cl is on the first carbon (the one with the double bond), methyl on the second (also part of the double bond). So the structure would be ClC(=C(CH3))CH2CH3. Wait, but double bonds have to be between two carbons. So the first carbon (C1) is Cl, double bond, and the second carbon (C2) has a methyl. So the SMILES would be Cl/C=C(\CH3)/CH2CH3? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's Cl-C(CH2CH3)=CH(CH3). But I'm not sure. This structural confusion is a problem. Maybe I should instead focus on whether it has a chiral center even without knowing exactly the structure.

Assuming that the molecule is (Z)-configured. The question is, does it have any chiral centers? Let's suppose that the double bond is between C1 and C2, which has Cl and a methyl group. If the substituents on the double bond are Cl and methyl on the same side (Z), is there a possibility of the molecule being chiral? But unless there's another stereogenic center, the molecule as a whole could be chiral if the double bond causes a non-planar structure. Wait, some alkenes can be chiral if the two groups on each end are different. Like allenes can have axial chirality. But for a regular alkene, is chirality possible?

Yes, if there are different substituents on either end. For example, if each carbon of the double bond has two different groups and the other two groups are also different, then the molecule can exhibit chirality. Wait, no, that's more like the case for allenes. For a regular alkene, the molecule can be non-superimposable on its mirror image if the two substituents on each carbon are different. This is called enantiomerism due to the double bond. The classic example is 1-chloro-1,2-difluoroethylene. So if the two carbons of the double bond each have two different substituents, and those substituents are arranged in a way that the whole structure isn't superimposable on its mirror image.

So let's check the first compound: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Let's suppose that the double bond is between C1 and C2. The substituents on C1 are Cl and the rest of the molecule (perhaps a CH2CH2 group?), and on C2, substituents are methyl and the rest of the molecule. If in the Z configuration, Cl and methyl are on the same side.

But to determine if the molecule is chiral, we need to see if the double bond creates a stereogenic axis. For double bond axial chirality, there must be two different groups on each carbon of the double bond. For example, if C1 has Cl and another group (like CH2CH3), and C2 has CH3 and another group (like CH2CH2?), but if both ends have two different substituents, then the molecule can be chiral. So in this case, if the groups are Cl and (probably a CH(CH2CH3)) on the left side and CH3 and a similar group on the right, then maybe the molecule has a stereogenic axis. If so, even though it's a double bond, the molecule is chiral. However, in the given compound name, it's specified as (Z), but perhaps even the Z and E isomers in such a molecule are enantiomers. 

Alternatively, if there exists a plane of symmetry in the molecule, it might not be chiral. So maybe in this case, even with Z configuration, there's internal symmetry? Let me think. If the structure is Cl on one end, methyl on the same side (Z) but the rest of the molecule is symmetrical. Suppose that the two carbons adjacent to the double bond perhaps mirror each other. For example, if the left carbon has Cl and CH2CH3, and the right carbon has methyl and CH2CH3. Then that would create a plane of symmetry. But in this case, the substituent on the other side of the double bond from Cl is a methyl and on the other side, maybe a different group. Maybe the compound is Cl-CH2-C(=CH2)-something? I'm still confused. 

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The presence of a double bond does not in itself make the molecule chiral unless the substituents around it create a non-superimposable mirror image. However, regardless of that, the first compound is given with a Z configuration. Let's suppose that the molecule does not have a chiral center but might have axial chirality. If it has axial chirality, then it would be optically active. But how to tell?

Alternatively, maybe there is a chiral center in this molecule. Let's assume that placing a chlorine on C1 and a methyl on C2 leads to a neighboring carbon having four different groups. For instance, perhaps C2 (the methyl-bearing carbon) is connected to the double bond, a methyl, and two other different groups. Wait, C2 would be part of the double bond (so two substituents from the double bond: one is C1 with Cl, and the other is C3). If C2 has a methyl and what else? If the rest of the groups are such that it's CH(CH3)-something. Hmm. Not sure. I'm stuck here. Maybe for expediency, I should note that if the problem is asking for how many compounds exhibit optical activity, and the first compound is a Z-alkene, which might or might not be chiral. If I recall, usually alkenes with different substituents on each carbon can have E/Z isomerism, but not necessarily chirality unless there's also a chiral center. Maybe this first compound isn't optically active. But I need to verify.

Alternatively, looking for another approach. A molecule is chiral if it lacks a plane of symmetry and has a stereogenic element (center, axis, plane). For the alkene's case, if the two ends each have two different substituents, then it's possible to have axial chirality. For example, when the four substituents are all different. For instance, abcdC=Cabcd. Wait, I'm not sure. Let me think of 2-pentene: if it's substituted such that each carbon of the double bond has two different groups, then it's possible to have E and Z, but not necessarily chiral. But in this case, the substituents need to be arranged in a way that mirror images are non-superimposable. For that, maybe the groups on each carbon have to be non-identical pairs.

Alternatively, if one carbon has groups A and B, and the other has groups C and D, then you have potential for chirality. For example, C(Cl)(R1)=C(R2)(R3), where R1, R2, R3 are different. But I think in most cases, unless there's some sort of spiral or allene structure, regular alkenes don't typically exhibit chirality on their own. So unless there is an additional chiral center, maybe the first compound isn't chiral. Alternatively, is there a chiral center elsewhere? Let's get back to the structure. If it's (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, maybe the rest of the molecule has a chiral center. 

But let's try again. "But" comes from butene, four carbons. The double bond is between 1 and 2. At position 1, there's a chlorine, and position 2 has a methyl. The rest would be CH2 and CH3. If we consider the double bond at C1-C2, the substituents on C1 would be Cl, a double bond to C2, and two more substituents (probably a CH2CH2 group). Wait, but carbon 1 can only have a maximum of four bonds. So Cl, double bond to C2, and two single bonds. Wait, that's three bonds? Ah, no. If C1 is part of a double bond (C1=C2), then C1 has two substituents aside from the double bond. For example, if but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, then C1 is CH2 (with the double bond). So substituting Cl on C1 would make it Cl-CH2-C=C... Wait, no. Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So substituting a Cl on C1 would be Cl-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? But that's not a but-1-ene anymore. I'm clearly misunderstanding something. Let's try building from scratch.

But-1-ene is four carbons with the double bond between carbons 1 and 2. The structure is CH2=CHCH2CH3. If we have 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene:

- Chloro is on carbon 1 (which is the first carbon of the double bond).
- Methyl on carbon 2 (the second carbon of the double bond).

So the structure would be Cl-C(=CH2CH3)-CH(CH3)-? I'm lost here. Wait, okay, perhaps the structure is: 

Carbon 1: Cl
Carbon 2: CH(CH3)
Double bond between 1 and 2
Then carbons 3 and 4 as two more CH2 groups or methyl?

Alternatively, maybe:

Cl  
|  
C=C  
                 /  
           CH(CH3)

Wait, but this would need the rest of the molecule. Alternatively, maybe another substituent. This is too unclear. Maybe I need to accept that my time is limited and make a judgment call.

If the molecule lacks any chiral centers, and doesn't have another form of chirality (like helical or axial), then it won't be optically active. Since I can't figure out the structure properly, perhaps the first compound (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene does not have a chiral center, as substituents on the double-bonded carbons may not be arranged to create a chiral center. Therefore, maybe not optically active.

Second compound: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione.

Okay, this is a complex bicyclic compound. The nomenclature suggests multiple rings. The key here is that it's got specified stereochemistry: 3aR and 7aS, plus E configuration for the chloromethylene group. The question is whether the molecule is chiral. The presence of multiple chiral centers (as indicated by the R/S designations) suggests that unless there's a plane of symmetry, the molecule is chiral. So given that it has specified stereochemistry (3aR,7aS,E), and the structure has multiple different substituents, likely this molecule is chiral. Because even if there are multiple chiral centers, as long as they are not meso compounds, they can be optically active. However, if the molecule has internal planes of symmetry making it meso, it would not. But given the complex structure (hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione) with substituents, and specific stereochemistry, I think this compound is optically active.

Third compound: (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid.

Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. The dimethyl substitution is on carbons 2 and 3. So this would be HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. The configuration is 2R and 3S. Let's draw it mentally. The molecule has two chiral centers. To be meso, the molecule would need an internal plane of symmetry. Let's check. If we mirror the molecule between carbons 2 and 3, would the configurations invert? If C2 is R and C3 is S, then considering the mirror plane between them, the configurations would become S at C2 and R at C3, but if the molecule is symmetrical, but with the centers exchanging configurations. Therefore, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then (2R,3S) would be a meso compound, making it achiral. Let's see. The succinic acid with two methyl groups on C2 and C3: The structure would be:

HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH

If you have mirror plane between C2 and C3, then the left side (HOOC-CH(CH3)-) is a mirror image of (-CH(CH3)-COOH). If the configurations are R and S, after mirroring, it would still be R and S but in a symmetrical arrangement. So for example, C2 (R) and C3 (S) would be mirror images. So the molecule would be superimposable on its mirror image, hence achiral. Therefore, (2R,3S)-dimethylsuccinic acid would be a meso compound, not optically active. Wait, no. Wait, if the two chiral centers are in a symmetrical position and the configurations are opposite, creating a plane of symmetry, then it's a meso compound. So in this case, with configuration (2R,3S), which are opposite, that would generate a plane of symmetry. Therefore, meso, so not optically active. So the third compound is not active.

Fourth compound: (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid.

Now the configurations are both R. So the molecule would have two chiral centers with the same configuration. Does this molecule have a plane of symmetry? Let's visualize. If the two methyl groups are on the same side (both R), then looking at the structure:

HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH

With both CH(CH3) groups in R configuration. If you arrange the R configurations, would there be a plane of symmetry? If both are R, presumably the molecule isn't symmetrical. A plane of symmetry would require that the left side mirrors the right. But if both centers are R, then arranging the groups would result in a non-superimposable mirror image, leading to chirality. Thus, (2R,3R) would not be meso and would be chiral. So this compound would be optically active.

Fifth compound: (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol.

This compound is cyclohexene with an alcohol group on carbon 1 and double bond at position 3 (between C3 and C4). The configuration is specified as R for the alcohol's carbon (C1). Cyclohexane rings can sometimes have symmetry, but in this case, there's a double bond at 3-en, which might affect the symmetry. However, the chiral center is at C1. Let's check if C1 has four different groups.

C1 would have:

- OH group
- two CH2 (or CH) groups connected to the ring
- And another substituent?

Wait, cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: the cyclohexene ring has a double bond between C3 and C4. The alcohol is on C1. Let's imagine the chair cyclohexane ring. At C1, the substituents are:

- OH (priority 1)
- The ring's adjacent carbons (C2 and C6)
- The ring's structure. Let's label the carbons: 1 (OH), 2, 3 (double bond to 4), 5, 6. So, C1 is connected to C2 and C6, both of which are CH2 (since there's a double bond between 3 and 4). So the substituents on C1 would be OH, two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6), and the rest of the ring. Wait, not sure. 

But cyclohexene's ring in chair form: when the double bond is present, it can't be in a chair, but maybe a half-chair or boat. However, regardless, the critical thing is whether C1 has four different groups. At C1, the substituents would be:

1. -OH
2. -CH2- (connecting to C2)
3. -CH2- (connecting to C6)
4. The rest of the ring. Wait, but in a cyclohexene ring, the other positions are connected through single bonds. Wait, maybe C1 has four substituents: OH, two CH2 (going to C2 and C6), and the cyclohexene ring structure. Wait, but cyclohexene has five other carbons. Hmm. No, each carbon in the cyclohexene ring is connected to two neighbors. So C1 is connected to C2 and C6, and also part of the ring. But in terms of substituents, if C1 is attached to two CH2 groups (bridges to C2 and C6), which in a cyclohexane are part of the ring.

Wait, wait. For the cyclohexene ring, C1 is substituted with an -OH. Then, C1 is also connected to C2 and C6, which are part of the ring. Now, if the rest of the ring is regular, does C1 have four different groups?

C1 has:

- OH (distinct)
- Two single bonds to adjacent carbons (C2 and C6). But during the ring formation, these two bonds are both CH2 groups (since in a cyclohexene ring, each carbon is bonded to two adjacent carbons and two substituents). But wait, with the double bond between C3 and C4, the geometry might affect the neighboring carbons.

Alternatively, maybe in cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, the C1 is connected to two CH2 groups (to C2 and C6) which are each part of the ring. Then, the substituents are OH, two CH2 groups (but both the same?), and the rest of the ring? But if the two CH2 groups are equivalent (i.e., part of the symmetric ring), then maybe C1 has only three different substituents: OH, two identical CH2 groups, and the rest of the ring (but the ring isn't different from the CH2 groups). Therefore, C1 would not have four different groups, so it's not a chiral center. Wait, that seems contradicted by the configuration given. The compound is specified as (R), so the person who named it must have considered C1 as a chiral center. Therefore, probably, the substituents around C1 are indeed four different groups. Let me think again. If cyclohexene is a ring with (starting at C1) then cyclo means the six-membered ring. C1 is connected to C2 and C6. The double bond is between C3 and C4, so positions are like C1, C2, C3 (double bonded to C4), C5, C6. So at C1, substitution is an -OH. Then, C2 is connected to C1 and C3. But with a double bond between C3 and C4, C3 would be sp² hybridized. Therefore, C2 is CH2 connected to C1 (which has OH) and to C3 (CH), which is part of the double bond. Wait, perhaps in this case, the substituents on C1 would be:

- OH group

- C2 (CH2 group connected to C3 (which is part of a double bond, making it different from a regular CH2))

- C6 (which is connected to C5, a CH2 group not part of a double bond)

Wait, but maybe the substituents on C1: 

From C1's perspective, the groups are:

1. OH (high priority)
2. C2 (which has a chain leading to C3 (double bond) and C1. But the actual groups are not adjacent. Hmm.)

Alternatively, the substituents are:

C1 is connected to:

- -OH

- C2 (which is connected to C3 with a double bond)

- C6 (which is connected to C5)

- The rest of the ring? Wait, but in a cyclohexene ring, all parts are connected. So the substituents may be considered as:

- OH

- Two bridgehead substituents (to C2 and C6)

- A hydrogen? No, if it's a 6-membered ring, each carbon has two hydrogens otherwise. Wait, maybe not if substituted. Wait, cyclophexene (cyclohex-3-ene) in chair form has Hs. If there's an OH on C1, then C1 has OH, and two CH groups (since in chair conformations, the cyclohexene may distort this). Hmm. 

But since the compound is named with (R) configuration, that means the C1 must have four different substituents, i.e., it is a chiral center. Thus, by the very fact that it is labeled R, this is a chiral molecule, hence optically active. So regardless of my confusion about the substituents, the compound is optically active.

Sixth compound: (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol.

This is a cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5, each in the s configuration. The question is whether this molecule is chiral. When you have substituents in a symmetric positions, like 1,3,5-triol with all same configurations (s), does that create a plane of symmetry? If the substituents are in a symmetric arrangement, the molecule may be meso.

If cyclohexane is a flat ring (though actually it's in a chair conformation), positions 1, 3, 5 are all axial or equatorial. Since each substituent is in the same configuration, say all axial upward, but arranged symmetrically. So 1,3,5-triol with hydroxyls all on the same face (or staggered in chair) would lead to a plane of symmetry. For example, if each OH is in the same position relative to the chair's axis, then the compound would have multiple planes of symmetry. For 1,3,5-triol, the molecule has a trigonal symmetry (C3 axis) but more importantly, has a plane of symmetry. For example, if considering stereoChemistry, all three OH groups are pointing up, the molecule can have a mirror plane.

Wait, but the configurations are given as 1s,3s,5s. Depending on how we assign the stereochemistry. If s configuration refers to the direction of the hydroxyl group relative to the ring. Wait, cyclohexane rings in chair conformations can have substituents axial or equatorial. If all three hydroxyls are axial (same face), then the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. But even more, the molecule would be symmetrical. For example, a cyclohexane with 1,3,5-triol, all in axial positions, creates a symmetrical arrangement. Each OH group is in the axial position. Then in that case, mirror plane would bisect between them. Hence, the molecule would be achiral. Therefore, it would be a meso compound. So even with three stereogenic centers, the symmetry makes it achiral. Hence, no optical activity. That’s if the configurations are such that they create a plane of symmetry. So if all are in s configurations (assuming opposite directions), but their arrangement leads to internal symmetry, then the molecule would be meso. Alternatively, 1,3,5 substituted with same stereochemistry but in symmetrical positions would result in an achiral molecule. Therefore, this compound is not optically active.

Seventh compound: 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one.

The structure here is butan-1-one, which is a ketone at position 1 (so (3-methylbutan-1-one) is O=C-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, but butan-1-one is pentan-2-one. Wait, maybe not. Wait, butan-1-one would be: (1) O=C-, then followed by three carbons. Wait, but butan-1-one would be a four-carbon chain with ketone at position 1, so the structure is (O=C)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. However, butan-1-one is not possible because ketones require the carbonyl to be between two carbons. So perhaps there’s a mistake. Wait, correct IUPAC: the ketone functional group (one) needs to be in a position such that it's between two carbons. So butan-1-one can't exist because you can't have a ketone on the first carbon as that would be a aldehyde group. Therefore, butan-1-one might instead be a typo here. Alternatively, maybe it's 3-methylbutan-1-one, which still seems conflicting. Wait, perhaps the correct way is 3-methylbutan-1-one would be a four-carbon chain with ketone at position 1, which is impossible. Therefore, the structure is probably wrong as written. Alternatively, maybe it's 3-methylbutan-2-one (which is pentan-3-one). Hmmm.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is meant to be 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So the ketone is at the first carbon (which must have two carbons attached), so R-C(=O)-. The rest is cyclopentyl. So it would be cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. But the first carbon (attached to cyclopentyl and ketone) is the cyclopentyl group. Wait, 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one:

The skeleton is butanone (four carbons with ketone at position 1— the first carbon. So: O=C-(CH2)3-CH3). But that's impossible. Wait, I think the problem is in the numbering. Butan-1-one would have the carbonyl at the end, which is an aldehyde. Hence, this is likely a misnomer. Probably the compound is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one with the ketone on the first carbon (but that's an aldehyde). Therefore, perhaps it’s a typo and should be butan-2-one. Alternatively, if we accept the name as is, then the compound is cyclopentane attached to the carbonyl group, as in cyclopentyl-CHO (but aldehyde). Then the 3-methylbutan- part refers to the adjacent carbon.

But no. There's confusion here. Let's look carefully: 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one.

Breaking down:

The main chain is butan-1-one. The carbonyl is at position 1. Then substituents: 1-cyclopentyl and 3-methyl. However, the butan-1-one would be:

O=C-R. The R would need to be -CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 (but wait, butan is four carbons, so impossible for ketone at position 1). So maybe the entire compound is (cyclopentyl)-(3-methylbutanoyl), but butanoyl is four carbons. Still confusing.

Alternatively, the correct name might be: The carbonyl is at position 1 of butane, which isn’t possible. Therefore, I think that the intended structure is a cyclopentyl group attached to a butanone where the ketone is at position 2. Let me consider another approach. If the compound is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, that would imply a structure where the ketone is at the cyclopentyl-substituted carbon. Hence, O=C(C5H9)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

But again, the ketone would require two carbons adjacent. However, in that case, the carbonyl carbon (C1) is bonded to the cyclopentyl group and three other carbons (part of the butan chain). Wait, that’s impossible, since a carbon can’t have five bonds. Wait, no. Wait, a ketone has a carbonyl group (C=O), so the carbon adjacent to O is the carbonyl carbon. So in butan-1-one, the structure would be O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. But such a compound would be pentan-2-one. I think the name has an error. In any case, despite the confusion, the question is, is this compound chiral? If the ketone is at a carbon that is attached to the cyclopentyl group and adjacent to a methyl, then we can look for a chiral center.

Assuming the structure is cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. The carbonyl is on the carbon connected to cyclopentyl. The carbonyl carbon itself is connected to O, cyclopentyl, and two CH2 groups. Thus, it's not a chiral center. The next carbon is CH(CH3). Let's look at this: butan-1-one is O=C-R, where R is a three-carbon chain. But if in this compound, R is properly the side chain. Suppose the carbonyl is located at the first carbon (O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3). Wait, now, but that's actually pentan-2-one with a methyl branch at position 3. However, names can sometimes be complex. If instead, the carbonyl carbon is attached directly to cyclopentyl and a three-carbon chain (CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3), then the carbonyl carbon has bonds to:

- O

- cyclopentyl

- CH(CH3)

- CH2CH3

Ah, wait, this would mean the carbonyl carbon has four different groups:

1. O (double bond, which I think counts as two groups but out of plane)

Wait, the carbonyl group is double bonded to O, so the carbonyl carbon (C1) would have three substituents: cyclopentyl, CH(CH3), and CH2CH3, but actually, in reality, the carbonyl group would be O=C. But the C=O is a double bond, so the chemistry is the carbon has three substituents (two from the double bond to O and one bond to R). So actually, carbonyl carbons are not chiral since they have two bonds to O. So the adjacent carbon (the one next to the carbonyl) would be CH(CH3). The structure might be:

Cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3

So in that case, the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl (C2) is CH(CH3), connected to C=O and two CH2 groups. Wait, how exactly?

Alternatively, C1: cyclopentyl-C(=O)-.

C2: connected to C1, has a CH(CH3), then two more CH2 groups leading to C4?

But let's again consider the intended structure to find any chiral centers. If the ketone is in a position such that the attached carbon is connected to three other substituents, then perhaps no. But given that the cyclopentyl group is a bulky substituent, but on the carbonyl carbon, which can’t be chiral. Then looking at the next carbon (say, in a four-carbon chain from the ketone):

If it's O=C-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, where the carbonyl is at position 1 and the chain is butyl. Then the second carbon (CH(CH3)) would have substituents:

- from C1: connected to carbonyl (O=C-)
- methyl (-CH3)
- two CH2 groups (leading to CH2-CH3)

But in reality, this would look like O=C-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, where the second carbon (CH(CH3)) has the following groups:

1. O=C-R (high priority)
2. CH3
3. CH2CH3
4. and a single bond to another CH2

Wait, no. Each carbon is connected to four groups. Let's draw this properly.

The entire compound's structure would be:

Cyclopentyl-(C=O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So for the carbon adjacent to the ketone (the second carbon in butanone):

It would have:

- One bond to C=O (priority I think highest)
- CH3 group (priority next)
- CH2CH3 (two CH2 groups leading to the end), but structure is taking time.

Alternatively, likely substituted such that:

At the carbon next to C=O (let's call it C2):

Groups attached are:

- CO-Cyclopentyl (from C1)
- CH3 (methyl)
- CH2CH2 (from the butan chain)
- Hydrogen

If yes, then C2 would have four different groups: COCyclopentyl, CH3, CH2CH3, and H. Wait, but depends on the actual arrangement. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are:

At C2 (assuming it's the -CH(CH3)- part):

It's attached to:

1. The carbon from the ketone (C=O-Ccyclopentyl)
2. Methyl group (CH3)
3. Two CH2 groups. 

Wait, but that is three substituents. Wait, maybe it's better to think that if the entire structure is cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, then the carbon adjacent to the ketone (i.e., the CH(CH3) carbon) is connected to:

- C=O
- CH3
- CH2-CH3
- and another CH2 from the backbone.

But no, the chain is linear. Let me correct. Wait, but butan-1-one would be O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 (but that is pentan-2-one). If there's a methyl branch at C3 (i.e., the third carbon), making it cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Therefore, the CH(CH3) carbon has:

- C=O group (attached cyclopentyl)
- CH3
- Two CH2 groups (to next carbon and the other CH2). Wait, in this structure, the first carbon is C=O, second is CH(CH3), third is CH2, fourth is CH3. Therefore, for the CH(CH3) (carbon 2):

Attached groups are:

1. -CO-Ccyclopentyl
2. -CH3
3. -CH2-CH2-CH3 (but actually, carbon 2 is connected directly to carbon 1 (C=O) and carbon 3 (CH2). Therefore:

At C2:

So:-CO-Ccyclopentyl (left)
-Ch (CH3) (the branching)
- two single bonds to adjacent carbons (C1 and C3). Wait, but each carbon can only have four bonds. So, the carbon (C2) in the chain (between C1 and C3) would be connected as follows:

C1: C=O
C2: connected to C1 and C3, with a methyl branch. So structure would be C=O -- C(CH3) -- CH2 -- CH3. So:

- At C2 (middle carbon): bonded to C1, C3, CH3, and another hydrogen.

In that case, the groups around C2 would be:

1. CO-Ccyclopentyl (high priority)
2. CH3
3. CH2CH3 (from the adjacent CH2)
4. a hydrogen

Therefore, C2 has four different groups: COCyclopentyl, CH3, CH2CH3, and H. Hence, it’s a chiral center. But even if that is the case, optically active.

Wait, is CO-Ccyclopentyl considered a single group? Yes, but when determining priorities, the substituents are broken down. The C2 carbon is connected to:

- A group (CO-Ccyclopentyl) -> which, when determining priority, would start by looking at the first atom, which is carbon. The CO-Ccyclopentyl group would have a carbonyl oxygen next.

But C2's substituents are:

- CO-Ccyclopentyl (where, for priority, the first atom is C, then O, so it's a ketone group)
- CH3
- CH2CH3
- H

Therefore, the priorities are:

1. CO-Ccyclopentyl (highest)
2. CH2CH3 (next, since after C comes C, higher than methyl which is C)
Wait, no. Priorities are based on the first atom. For CO-Ccyclopentyl: first atom is C (of CO), attached to O. For CH2CH3 and CH3: first atoms are C. Now, compare the substituents:

First substituent: CO-Ccyclopentyl: highest priority as O is attached next.
Second substituent: CH2CH3: The first atom is C, next attached atoms are H, H, C (if you go further, but the first point of difference is whether the atom attached to the C has higher priority. The substituents are:

- CO-pentyl: C attached to O and another C.
- CH2CH3: C attached to C and two H.
- CH3: C attached to three Hs.
- H.

So, the priority order would be COcyclopentyl (highest), CH2CH3 (C connected to another C), then CH3, then H. Therefore, substituents are all different. So yes, the C2 carbon is a chiral center, making the molecule chiral. Hence, the compound would be optically active.

But wait, earlier confusion about the structure may mean differently. Alternatively, if the ketone is at C1 and cyclopentyl attached there, but the ketone carbon cannot be a chiral center as it's double-bonded to O.

Therefore, if C2 has four different groups, this compound would be optically active.

But given the name likely has a misnomer (butan-1-one), but if we take the structure as written, it does have a chiral center. So this compound is optically active.

Now, tallying up:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Maybe not, but initial assessment without clear structure. Hmmm, perhaps I need to revisit.

For axial chirality in the first compound: If the double bond is between C1 and C2 with Cl and methyl groups on each. Then for axial chirality, does each carbon of the double bond have two different groups?

C1: Cl and another group (say, a CH2CH3)
C2: Methyl and another group (say, CH2CH3)
If these are different (but symmetrical), maybe generating a mirror. Alternatively, if one end is Cl and methyl, while the other is two other groups, which could allow for non-superimposable mirror images. 

Alternatively, suppose after proper drawing, C1 has Cl, and some asymmetric groups leading to a chiral center. But with difficulty in assessing, maybe I should make a call. Since they didn't specify "how" it's chiral, and multiple-choice questions often only consider chiral centers (not considering axial). If there's no chiral center (if structure isn't clear) it's not optically active. Given confusion, but assuming that a chlorine and a methyl could be different enough, with Z configuration, leading to possible axial chirality. If four different groups on each carbon of double bond, then could be chiral. For example, if C1: Cl and CH2CH2, so different from C2: CH3 and CH2CH3. Then in Z configuration, the higher priority groups (Cl and CH3) are on same side. But if there are two different groups on each carbon, then axial chirality is possible. 

But mostly, axial chirality comes into play with allenes (cumulated dienes) or biphenyls. Regular alkenes might not be considered for axial chirality. Given that uncertainty, perhaps it's not considered optically active.

So tentative conclusions:

1. Not active.
2. Active.
3. Not active.
4. Active.
5. Active.
6. Not active.
7. Active.

Total of 2,4,5,7 which are active. That’s four compounds. However, seventh may be active, Mh….

Alternatively, the seventh might be an amino acid?

Wait, I was considering seventh compound as chiral? Resulting in four actives. But let me check again. If seventh compound's structure after resolving has a chiral center, and committee obtained yes, choice with four actives: Nos. 2,4,5,7. Is seven correct?

Alternatively, is there a plane of symmetry elsewhere?

In 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, if the adjacent carbon has four different groups (COcyclopentyl, CH3, CH2CH3, H), it's a chiral center.

Therefore, seventh is active, making four in total. So answer is 4.

But wait, maybe compound 5 (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol actually does not have four different substituents. Let's confirm.

Yes, C1 in cyclohexene-ol. If the substituents are:

- HO-
- two CH2 groups (part of the ring)
- the rest of the ring

But if the ring's adjacent parts differ because of the double bond. Wait, with the double bond between C3 and C4. So looking at C1, connected to C2 and C6. The double bond being at C3 affects whether C6 is different from C2. If C2 is adjacent to C3 (which is double-bonded to C4), whereas C6 is adjacent to C5 (no double bond), then C2 and C6 have different environments, leading C1 to have four different groups: HO, C2 (which leads to a double bond), C6 (leading to a single bond), and the other group. Therefore, three different groups: HO, two differing CH groups (C2 and C6), and a hydrogen? Wait, no. For cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, perhaps the structure is such that C1 has four different substituents. Hence, (R) configuration, making it a chiral center.

Therefore, if the name specifies (R) configuration, then by IUPAC rules it must be a chiral center. So compound 5 is optically active.

Thus, total number of active compounds:

Compound 2 (yes), compound 4 (yes), compound 5 (yes), compound 7 (yes). Compound 2 is yes, compounds 4 is yes, 5 is yes, and 7 is yes, for a total of four compounds.

Wait but how many is me checking? So, after review:

1: Not active

2: Active

3: Not

4: Active

5: Active

6: Not

7: Active

Hence, 4 active compounds.

But the initial answer I thought it's 4, but based on original assessment.

So probably the answer is **4**
