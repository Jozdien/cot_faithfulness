The physical theory that never requires regularization at high energies is **N=4 Super Yang-Mills (SYM)**. This theory is a maximally supersymmetric conformal field theory in 4 dimensions. Due to its high degree of symmetry (including supersymmetry and conformal invariance), loop diagrams in perturbative calculations exhibit cancellations between bosonic and fermionic contributions, rendering all ultraviolet divergences finite. Consequently, N=4 SYM does not require regularization techniques (e.g., dimensional regularization) to handle divergences, even at high energies. Its conformal nature ensures no running coupling (beta function vanishes to all orders), making it a finite theory. Other standard theories like Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), or the Standard Model require regularization due to divergent loop integrals, while General Relativity is non-renormalizable and necessitates additional UV completion.

Okay, let's see. The question is asking which of the physical theories doesn't require regularization at high energies. Hmm. First, I need to recall what regularization means here. From what I remember in quantum field theory, regularization is a method used to deal with divergences, like infinities that pop up in calculations. So, when we have loop integrals, for example, they often give infinite results, and regularization techniques like cutoff regularization, dimensional regularization, or Pauli-Villars are used to make these finite. Then, you use renormalization to absorb these infinities into physical parameters.

So the question is about which theory doesn't need this process at high energies. The possible options aren't listed here, but since it's a standard question, I think the common choices might be things like Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), General Relativity, the Standard Model, or maybe some effective field theories or supersymmetric theories. But since the user hasn't given the options, I need to think in general.

Theories that are "renormalizable" don't require introducing new parameters at each order of perturbation theory, but even renormalizable theories still need regularization to handle the divergences. However, non-renormalizable theories have worse divergences and require an infinite number of counterterms, which makes them less predictive unless you have a cutoff scale. Then there are finite theories, which don't have divergences at all. For example, some supersymmetric theories, like N=4 SYM (Super Yang-Mills), are known to be finite. But wait, N=4 SYM is a conformal field theory and doesn't have a beta function, so it's scale-invariant, which might mean it doesn't need renormalization. But is it the case that finiteness implies no need for regularization?

Alternatively, maybe a theory that's ultraviolet (UV) complete doesn't require regularization because it's well-defined at all energy scales. And then there's the contrast between effective theories and fundamental theories. Effective theories have a cutoff energy beyond which they break down and require a more fundamental theory. For example, the Fermi theory of weak interactions is an effective theory which is non-renormalizable and gets replaced by the electroweak theory at higher energies. On the other hand, a renormalizable theory like QED or the Standard Model can be used up to very high energies, but they still require regularization to handle the loop divergences. However, even the Standard Model may eventually hit a problem, like the Landau pole in QED, which suggests that at very high energies, QED would need a cutoff, but maybe that's more of a hypothetical concern.

Alternatively, General Relativity, when quantized, is non-renormalizable and requires regularization, and probably a UV completion like string theory. So among the theories, maybe the ones that are asymptotically safe? Asymptotic safety is a concept where the theory becomes safe at high energies due to a UV fixed point. But whether such theories exist is still a research topic, and I don't know if standard GR is considered asymptotically safe.

But the question is not about whether the theory is UV complete or not, but which one never requires regularization at high energies. Regularization is a step in the calculation, so if a theory is finite, like N=4 SYM, then maybe its calculations don't produce divergences that need regularization. Because in N=4 SYM, due to high supersymmetry, the beta functions vanish, so it's a conformal theory, and perhaps all loop corrections cancel out. That would mean that loop integrals are finite, so you don't need to regularize them. Thus, in that case, you wouldn't need regularization. So supersymmetric theories might be a candidate here. Alternatively, maybe topological theories, like Chern-Simons theories in 3D, which don't have propagating degrees of freedom and their integrals might be finite?

Alternatively, some people say that in certain theories, like maybe quantum mechanics (as opposed to QFT), there are no divergences. But I think the question is about physical theories, which are QFTs. So which QFTs are finite? The Standard Model isn't; QED isn't. So perhaps the answer is N=4 Super Yang-Mills or another finite QFT. But I need to recall if N=4 SYM is actually finite. For example, in SYM theories, with maximal supersymmetry (N=4), the theory is conformal, and it's believed that the beta function is zero to all orders, leading to no need for renormalization. Therefore, the Green's functions might not have UV divergences, hence not needing regularization. If that's the case, then that theory doesn't require regularization.

Alternatively, is there a lower-dimensional theory? For example, certain 2D CFTs perhaps? Like if you take a conformal field theory, maybe they don't need regularization because they are scale-invariant. But actually, even in CFTs, when you compute quantities like operator product expansions, you can have divergences that require regularization. But maybe UV divergences in their correlators are handled by the structure of the theory. Hmmm. Maybe, but CFTs are typically considered as the IR or UV fixed points of RG flows, but they still have certain divergences. For example, in a 2D CFT, the two-point function of a primary operator is singular as the points come together, which is a kind of UV divergence. But in the CFT context, this is handled by the operator product expansion rather than through regularization, so perhaps.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is a free theory, since interactions lead to divergences. In a free (non-interacting) QFT, there are no loops, so maybe you don't need regularization? But if the question is about a theory that never requires regularization, even if you consider interactions... but free theories have no interactions. So their perturbative expansion is trivial, so perhaps no divergences. But is a free theory considered as not needing regularization? But I think in that case, you don't need it, but the question might be aiming for a different answer. If the available options included free theories, then that would be the case, but probably the intended answer is N=4 SYM. Wait, maybe the options include things like "Quantum Electrodynamics", "General Relativity", "Standard Model", "N=4 Super Yang-Mills", or "Fermi theory".

Wait, the original question is asking "which of the following physical theories never requires regularization at high energies". The user hasn't provided the options, but perhaps the assistant has the common answers in mind. From what I can recall, this type of question usually refers to renormalizable vs. non-renormalizable. But even renormalizable theories require regularization. Finiteness is a different concept.

Alternatively, the answer might be "Asymptotically free theories," but QCD is asymptotically free. Wait, asymptotic freedom means that the coupling becomes weaker at high energies, so QCD perturbative calculations become more reliable at high energies. However, regularization is needed regardless when you do loop calculations. So even in an asymptotically free theory, you need to regularize your integrals. But at high energies, since the coupling is weak, the perturbative expansion is valid, so maybe higher-order terms are less important, but regularization is still required to compute individual diagrams.

But if a theory is UV finite, then in such a theory, even loop diagrams don't produce divergences. Therefore, it never requires regularization. Which theories are finite? As I mentioned, certain supersymmetric theories, especially maximally supersymmetric ones like N=4 SYM in 4D. So, supersymmetry provides cancellations between bosonic and fermionic loops. For example, in N=4 SYM, which is a conformal theory, the beta function is zero, so the coupling doesn't run, and it's believed that all divergences cancel out, leading to finite amplitudes. Therefore, such a theory would not require regularization. If that's the intended answer, then N=4 Super Yang-Mills is the theory that never requires regularization. But if the options don't have that, then perhaps... not sure. But since maybe the user is expecting "QED" or "Standard Model", but they do require regularization. General Relativity requires regularization, even more so because it's non-renormalizable.

Alternatively, another candidate might be a theory that is "already regularized" in some sense, but none come to mind. So putting this together, the most likely answer is that N=4 Super Yang-Mills doesn't require regularization due to its finiteness from supersymmetry. Hence, even at high energies, there are no divergences to regularize. Yes, this seems to fit.
