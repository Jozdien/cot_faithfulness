# R1 response

To find the kinetic energy of the product particles in the decay process \(\pi^+ \to \mu^+ + \nu\) where the pion \((\pi^+)\) is stationary, we start by using conservation of energy and momentum.

1. **Rest Mass Energies**:
   - Rest mass of \(\pi^+\): \(139.6 \, \text{MeV}\)
   - Rest mass of \(\mu^+\): \(105.7 \, \text{MeV}\)
   - Neutrino (\(\nu\)) is assumed massless.

2. **Conservation of Energy**:
   The total energy of the pion is converted into the total energy of the muon and neutrino:
   \[
   E_{\pi} = E_{\mu} + E_{\nu}
   \]
   where \(E_{\pi} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}\), \(E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + (105.7)^2}\), and \(E_{\nu} = p\) (since the neutrino is massless).

3. **Conservation of Momentum**:
   Since the pion is initially stationary, the momenta of the muon and neutrino are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction:
   \[
   p_{\mu} = p_{\nu} = p
   \]

4. **Solving for Momentum**:
   Substituting the energy equations into the conservation of energy equation:
   \[
   \sqrt{p^2 + (105.7)^2} + p = 139.6
   \]
   Solving for \(p\):
   \[
   \sqrt{p^2 + 105.7^2} = 139.6 - p
   \]
   Squaring both sides:
   \[
   p^2 + 105.7^2 = (139.6 - p)^2
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   p^2 + 105.7^2 = 139.6^2 - 2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot p + p^2
   \]
   \[
   105.7^2 = 139.6^2 - 2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot p
   \]
   \[
   2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot p = 139.6^2 - 105.7^2
   \]
   \[
   p = \frac{139.6^2 - 105.7^2}{2 \cdot 139.6}
   \]
   Calculating the numerator:
   \[
   139.6^2 - 105.7^2 = (139.6 - 105.7)(139.6 + 105.7) = 33.9 \times 245.3 = 8315.67
   \]
   Therefore:
   \[
   p = \frac{8315.67}{2 \cdot 139.6} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}
   \]

5. **Kinetic Energy Calculation**:
   - **Neutrino**: Since it is massless, its kinetic energy is equal to its momentum:
     \[
     K_{\nu} = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}
     \]
   - **Muon**: Kinetic energy is total energy minus rest mass energy:
     \[
     E_{\mu} = \sqrt{(29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2} \approx 109.82 \, \text{MeV}
     \]
     \[
     K_{\mu} = 109.82 - 105.7 = 4.12 \, \text{MeV}
     \]

### Final Answer
The kinetic energy of the muon is \(\boxed{4.12 \text{ MeV}}\) and the kinetic energy of the neutrino is \(\boxed{29.8 \text{ MeV}}\).

# R1 reasoning

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in the pion decay process: π⁺ → μ⁺ + ν. The pion is initially stationary, and we're given the rest masses of π⁺ and μ⁺ as 139.6 MeV and 105.7 MeV respectively. The neutrino's rest mass is negligible, right? I think we can assume it's zero for this calculation. 

First, since the pion is at rest, its total energy is just its rest mass energy, which would be 139.6 MeV. When it decays into a muon and a neutrino, those two particles must share the energy. But energy and momentum are conserved here. Hmm, okay.

Let me recall that in particle decays, if the parent particle is at rest, the total momentum of the decay products should be zero. So, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. But the neutrino is very light (assuming massless), so maybe its energy is equal to its momentum? Because for massless particles, E = pc. Whereas for the muon, since it has mass, its energy is sqrt(p²c² + m²c⁴), but maybe we can work in units where c=1 to simplify. Yeah, that's probably easier.

So let's set c=1. Then, the energy of the pion is all rest mass: E_π = m_π = 139.6 MeV. 

For the decay products: the muon and neutrino. Let me denote the muon as μ and neutrino as ν. The energy of the muon is E_μ = sqrt(p² + m_μ²), and the energy of the neutrino is E_ν = p, since it's massless. 

Because momentum is conserved, the magnitude of the muon's momentum should equal the magnitude of the neutrino's momentum, but in opposite directions. So p_μ = -p_ν. But since we're dealing with magnitudes, p = |p_μ| = |p_ν|. 

So the total energy is E_μ + E_ν = sqrt(p² + m_μ²) + p = m_π. 

So, let's write that equation: sqrt(p² + m_μ²) + p = m_π. 

Then, solving for p. Let's move one term to the other side:

sqrt(p² + m_μ²) = m_π - p

Then square both sides:

p² + m_μ² = (m_π - p)² = m_π² - 2 m_π p + p²

Subtract p² from both sides:

m_μ² = m_π² - 2 m_π p

Then, solving for p:

2 m_π p = m_π² - m_μ²

p = (m_π² - m_μ²)/(2 m_π)

Okay, so plugging in the numbers here. m_π is 139.6 MeV, m_μ is 105.7 MeV.

Calculate numerator first: (139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2. 

Wait, that's like (a^2 - b^2) which factors into (a - b)(a + b). Maybe that's easier. Let me compute:

a = 139.6, b = 105.7

a - b = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9

a + b = 139.6 + 105.7 = 245.3

So numerator is (33.9)(245.3). Let me compute 33.9 * 245.3.

First, 30 * 245.3 = 7,359

3.9 * 245.3 = let's see, 3 * 245.3 = 735.9; 0.9 *245.3 = 220.77. So total 735.9 + 220.77 = 956.67

So total numerator is 7,359 + 956.67 = 8,315.67 (MeV²)

Denominator is 2 * 139.6 = 279.2 MeV

Hence, p = 8,315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let's calculate:

Divide 8,315.67 by 279.2.

First, approximate 279.2 * 30 = 8,376. So that's more than 8,315.67. 

So 279.2 * 29.8 = 279.2*(30 - 0.2) = 8,376 - 55.84 = 8,320.16

Which is a bit more than 8,315.67. So approximately 29.8 - (8,320.16 - 8,315.67)/279.2

Difference is 4.49, so 4.49 / 279.2 ≈ 0.016

So 29.8 - 0.016 ≈ 29.784. So approximately 29.78 MeV.

So p ≈ 29.78 MeV/c, but since we have c=1, it's 29.78 MeV.

But wait, let me be precise. Alternatively, use calculator steps.

8,315.67 ÷ 279.2. Let me do that more accurately:

279.2 | 8,315.67

Calculate how many times 279.2 fits into 8,315.67.

Multiply 279.2 * 20 = 5,584.00

8,315.67 - 5,584 = 2,731.67

Now, 279.2 * 9 = 2,512.8

2,731.67 - 2,512.8 = 218.87

279.2 * 0.8 = 223.36, which is a bit too much. So 0.78 * 279.2.

0.7 * 279.2 = 195.44

0.08 *279.2 = 22.336

Total 195.44 +22.336=217.776

Subtract from 218.87: 218.87 -217.776=1.094

So remaining is 1.094, so that's 1.094 /279.2 ≈0.0039

Total p=20 +9 +0.78 +0.0039 ≈29.7839 MeV

So approximately 29.784 MeV. Let's just use 29.8 MeV for simplicity.

Wait, but the pion mass is 139.6 and muon is 105.7, so maybe I did the calculation right.

Now, then, once we have the momentum, we can find the energy of the muon and neutrino.

E_ν = p ≈29.8 MeV

E_μ = sqrt(p² + m_μ²) = sqrt(29.8² +105.7²)

Calculate 29.8² = 888.04

105.7² = 11,172.49

Adding them: 888.04 +11,172.49 ≈12,060.53

Square root of 12,060.53: sqrt(12,060.53). Since 110²=12,100, which is a bit over. 110²=12,100. 109²=11,881. So 109.8²=109² +2*109*0.8 +0.8²=11,881 +174.4 +0.64=12,056.04. Close to 12,060.53. The difference is 12,060.53 -12,056.04=4.49. So each 0.1 increase in 109.8 gives approx 2*109.8*0.1 +0.1²=21.96 +0.01≈21.97. So for 4.49, that would be about 4.49 /21.97≈0.204. So sqrt≈109.8 +0.204≈110.004 MeV. Hmm. Wait, more precisely, let me check:

Let x = 109.8, x^2 =12,056.04

At x + δ, (x + δ)^2 ≈x² +2xδ +δ². So δ ≈ (12,060.53 -x²)/(2x) =4.49/(2*109.8)≈4.49/219.6≈0.0204.

So sqrt is ≈109.8 +0.0204=109.8204 MeV≈109.82 MeV.

But let me calculate 109.82^2:

109^2=11,881

0.82^2=0.6724

2*109*0.82=178.76

So (109 +0.82)^2=11,881 +178.76 +0.6724≈12,060.43, which is almost 12,060.53, so with a slight error. Close enough. So E_μ ≈109.82 MeV.

Then, the total energy is E_μ + E_ν ≈109.82 +29.8≈139.62 MeV, which matches the pion mass (139.6), considering rounding errors. Good.

Now, the kinetic energy of the muon is its total energy minus its rest mass. Rest mass of muon is 105.7 MeV, so K_μ =109.82 -105.7≈4.12 MeV.

Wait, really? Only 4.12 MeV? So the muon's kinetic energy is about 4.12 MeV. And the neutrino carries away around 29.8 MeV, but since it's (approximately) massless, its energy is all kinetic. Wait, but if the neutrino is massless, then its energy is equal to its kinetic energy. For the muon, since it has mass, its kinetic energy is total energy minus rest mass.

Therefore, the KE of the product particles: muon has 4.12 MeV and neutrino has 29.8 MeV.

But the question is to find the KE of product particles. It might be asking for both, but since it's using plural, "product particles", which are muon and neutrino. However, sometimes in such problems, they might just be asking for the KE of the massive particle, because neutrinos are hard to detect. But here let's see, the problem statement says "Find KE of product particles in, Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu here Pi(+) is stationary." So probably both. Let me check rest mass of neutrino. Standard Model neutrinos have negligible mass, so we can safely take m_ν=0. Then the neutrino's energy is all kinetic. So the kinetic energy of the neutrino is equal to its energy, 29.8 MeV, and the KE of the muon is around 4.12 MeV. So summing these gives the total kinetic energy of the system: 4.12 +29.8≈33.92 MeV. But the initial pion was at rest. Wait, but conservation of energy: total energy should be consistent.

Wait, before decay, total energy is just m_π c², so 139.6 MeV. After decay, total energy is the sum of the muon's energy and the neutrino's energy. Since the pion is at rest, all energy in decay products is from the rest mass, so their kinetic energies plus their rest masses sum up to the pion's rest mass. Wait, but wait:

E_initial = m_π c² = E_final = E_μ + E_ν

But E_μ includes the rest mass energy of the muon. Therefore:

K_μ + K_ν = (E_μ - m_μ c²) + E_ν = (E_μ + E_ν) - m_μ c² = m_π c² - m_μ c² ≈139.6 -105.7 =33.9 MeV

Which is the sum of the kinetic energies. Which matches our previous approximate value. So the total KE of the products is 33.9 MeV, but divided between muon and neutrino. So in the problem, it's not entirely clear if they want individual KE or total. But it says "KE of product particles", maybe each of them? Let's see.

But the problem is written in a way that it's possible they want the KE of each. But then again, in some textbooks, decay problems the KE of the massive particle is calculated via (m_pi - m_mu)^2 / (2 m_pi), but not sure. Let me check with numbers. If we use the formula from two-body decay when the parent is at rest.

Another way: The kinetic energy of the muon is E_μ - m_μ. Which we found around 4.12 MeV, which seems low. Let me check the formula for two-body decay.

I recall for the decay M → m1 + m2, if M is at rest, then the kinetic energy of m1 can be computed as ((M^2 - (m1 + m2)^2)(M^2 - (m1 - m2)^2))/(4 M^2)) ? Wait, that gives something different. Or maybe another formula. Since in this case, one particle is massless (neutrino), m2=0.

Wait, let's recast variables. Let parent mass M = m_pi. Daughter particles m and 0.

Then KE of massive daughter (muon) would be?

From conservation of energy and momentum:

E1 + E2 = M (since c=1)

p1 = p2 (since momentum is opposite. Let the muon be particle 1 (mass m) neutrino particle 2 (mass 0).

So, E1 = sqrt(p^2 + m^2)

E2 = p (since m2=0)

Thus,

sqrt(p² + m^2) + p = M

So, leading to (as before)

sqrt(p² + m²) = M - p

Squaring both sides:

p² + m² = M² - 2 M p + p²

Cancel p²,

m² = M² - 2 M p

Thus, p = (M² - m²)/(2 M)

So, same as above.

So then E1 = sqrt( p² + m² ) = sqrt( ((M² - m²)/(2 M))² + m² )

Let me compute that:

= sqrt( (M^4 - 2 M² m² + m^4) / (4 M²) + m² )

= sqrt( [M^4 - 2 M² m² + m^4 + 4 M² m² ] / (4 M²) )

= sqrt( [M^4 + 2 M² m² + m^4] / (4 M²) )

Wait, numerator is M^4 + 2 M² m² + m^4 = (M² + m²)^2. So,

= sqrt( (M² + m²)^2 / (4 M²) ) ) = (M² + m²)/(2 M )

Hence, E1 = (M² + m²)/(2 M )

Hence, the KE of the muon is E1 - m = (M² + m²)/(2 M ) - m = (M² + m² - 2 M m )/(2 M ) = (M - m)^2/(2 M )

Ah, so the KE of the muon should be (M - m)^2/(2 M )

So plugging in numbers: (139.6 -105.7)^2/(2*139.6 )

Calculate (33.9)^2 =1,149.21, denominator: 279.2

Hence, KE =1,149.21 /279.2 ≈4.117 MeV. So approximately 4.117 MeV.

That matches our previous calculation of 4.12 MeV. So that's more precise. So the KE of the muon is (M - m)^2 / (2 M )

So ≈4.117 MeV. Round to four significant figures, 4.117 MeV? Suppose we treat the given masses as four significant figures: 139.6 and 105.7, both four sig figs.

Compute with exact numbers:

M =139.6, m=105.7

M -m= 33.9

Square is 33.9^2=1,149.21

Denominator: 2*139.6=279.2

So 1,149.21/279.2 ≈4.117. So about 4.117 MeV. Maybe we can present it as 4.12 MeV. Depends on how precise they need.

Alternatively, maybe we can write the exact fraction.

Well, let's compute (139.6 -105.7) exactly:

139.6 -105.7=33.9 MeV.

So (33.9)^2=33.9*33.9. Let's compute that 30*30=900, 30*3.9=117, 3.9*30=117, 3.9*3.9=15.21. So 900 +117 +117 +15.21= 900 +234 +15.21=1,149.21

Which is 1,149.21 MeV².

Divide by 2*139.6=279.2 MeV.

Thus: KE =1,149.21 /279.2.

Now, if we compute this division: 1,149.21 ÷279.2.

Since 279.2 x4=1,116.8, subtract that from 1,149.21, get 1,149.21 -1,116.8=32.41.

Now 32.41 ÷279.2= approx0.116. So 4.116. So total KE is≈4.116 MeV≈4.12 MeV.

Yes, so muon's KE is approximately 4.12 MeV, and the neutrino's KE is 29.78 MeV, so total KE≈33.9 MeV.

Since the question is worded as "Find KE of product particles", but if we have to give in boxed format, most likely the answer expects the KE of the muon. Because the neutrino's KE is tricky, but in many problems they only ask for the observable particle, which is the muon. However, since neutrino is also a product particle, but in some contexts, the question might need both, unless specified.

Looking again at the problem statement:

"Find KE of product particles in,

Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu

here Pi(+) is stationary.

Rest mass of Pi(+) & mu(+) is 139.6 MeV & 105.7 MeV respectively."

Product particles are mu+ and nu. It doesn't specify which one, so need to find both?

But in some textbooks, when I've seen similar pion decay problems, usually the answer given is only the muon's KE, perhaps because the neutrino's KE is relatively straightforward if we remember it. Or sometimes the question might have a typo and maybe wants the total KE. Alternatively, since in high energy physics, they usually provide all three, but perhaps the problem is designed with the answer in a box of single value? But considering neutrinos where their KE is equal to their energy (since massless), it's possible they expect both.

But the problem probably states mu and nu. Given that, but since the user probably just expects me to calculate the kinetic energy of one of them? Let me check the problem statement again:

"Find KE of product particles [...]"

So plural, implying both? So we have two product particles: muon and neutrino. Both of which will have KE. So ideally, answer is two values. But the system might need the KE of perhaps both particles?

Wait, but re-examining the original problem:

In the decay of the pion at rest into a muon and a neutrino, find the kinetic energies of the product particles. Since energy and momentum are conserved. 

Typically, when dealing with such two-body decays, especially with one massless particle (neutrino), there's a formula for the kinetic energy of the massive particle. For example, as I found above, the KE is (M - m)^2/(2 M ). But then the neutrino's KE would be total energy minus the energy in the muon. But the problem is presented as K E of both product particles.

Thus, perhaps write both kinetic energies. But let me see.

Alternatively, given that the user just wants the answer formatted in \boxed{}, maybe separate answers?

But the instructions mention:

"Find KE of product particles [...] Please [...] put your final answer within \boxed{}."

In similar physics problems, sometimes multiple answers can be given in separate boxes. But if only one box is expected, perhaps total KE?

But not sure. If we present two values, but they expect combined, how to solve that confusion. Alternatively, reading from standard pion decay problems, the kinetic energy of the muon is around 4.1 MeV.

Wait, in real life, the muon from pion decay at rest has KE≈4.1 MeV, which is a standard result, e.g., from the classic example. For example, here's the standard approach:

The pion (mass m_π) decays into a muon (mass m_μ) and a neutrino (mass 0).

Then, using conservation of energy: m_π = E_μ + E_ν

Conservation of momentum: |p_μ| = |p_ν| = p

E_ν = p (since neutrino is massless)

E_μ = sqrt( p^2 + m_μ^2 )

Then, adding together:

sqrt( p^2 + m_μ^2 ) + p = m_π

Solving for p:

sqrt( p^2 + m_μ^2 ) = m_π - p

Square both sides:

p^2 + m_μ^2 = m_π² - 2 m_π p + p²

Cancel p²:

m_μ² = m_π² - 2 m_π p

So:

2 m_π p = m_π² - m_μ²

Thus:

p = (m_π² - m_μ²) / (2 m_π )

Then, the kinetic energy of the muon is:

K_μ = E_μ - m_μ = sqrt( p^2 + m_μ^2 ) - m_μ

We already found E_ mu to be ( m_π² + m_μ² )/( 2m_π )

So, subtract m_μ:

K_μ = ( m_π² + m_μ² )/(2m_π ) - m_μ

= (m_π² + m_μ² - 2 m_π m_μ )/( 2 m_π )

= (m_π - m_μ )² / ( 2 m_π )

So KE muon is (139.6 -105.7)^2 / (2*139.6 )≈ (33.9)^2/(279.2 )≈1,149.21/279.2≈4.116 MeV, as before.

The neutrino's kinetic energy is E_ν= p = (m_π² - m_μ²)/(2 m_π )

So, substituting the given values:

Numerator: m_π² - m_μ²=139.6² - 105.7²=(139.6 -105.7)(139.6 + 105.7 )=33.9*245.3=8,315.67

Denominator: 2*139.6=279.2

So p=8,315.67 /279.2≈29.78 MeV/c. Since the neutrino's kinetic energy is p*c, so in units where c=1, K_nu=29.78 MeV.

Hence, the two KE are:

Muon: ≈4.12 MeV

Neutrino:≈29.78 MeV

Thus, if the question is to find both, but the answer should be presented boxed, but how? Because there are two answers.

But looking at the user instruction:

"Find KE of product particles in, Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu here Pi(+) is stationary. [...] put your final answer within \boxed{}."

Possibly they expect both, but \boxed doesn’t handle multiple. But some people use comma-separated or clarify. If they follow standard decay results, it's typically expected people recognize the procedure. Since muon is the charged particle, perhaps only its KE is needed? But it's not specified. Alternatively, mention both but with formatting.

Alternatively, does the problem want the sum? Total kinetic energy would be 33.9 MeV, but again, since the problem says "product particles" I think they might want both.

But how?

Alternatively given that, maybe only the muon's KE is considered, as the neutrino's is academic. Given that, the answer is approximately 4.12 MeV.

Wait but looking around online for similar problems, for decay of a pion at rest, the muon's kinetic energy is slightly over 4 MeV. For example, here (thought experiment):

When a charged pion at rest decays into a muon and a neutrino, the muon is emitted with a kinetic energy of approximately 4.1 MeV. This is a standard problem in relativity. Hence, likely the expected answer is about 4.1 MeV. But since we computed 4.116MeV, using the exact formula.

Alternatively, perhaps we are to report both, but given the problem says "KE of product particles", and Muon and neutrino. Hence, the kinetic energy of the muon is ~4.12MeV and the neutrino is ~29.78MeV.

If needing as two answers, but here the instructions say "put your final answer within \boxed{}." Maybe two boxes? The assistant is allowed to use multiple boxes or write both KE's separately.

But the user's original instruction would be meta to that, need perhaps see the associated text.

But since system allows for boxed multiple via two boxes. So I would type:

The kinetic energy of the muon is \boxed{4.12 \text{ MeV}} and the kinetic energy of the neutrino is \boxed{29.8 \text{ MeV}}. 

Alternatively, if one total, but no.

Alternatively, in presentation in Chinese maybe separated with comma, but instructions mention the system, maybe follow the calculation of moving forward. Since 4.12 and 29.8 sum to approximately the total rest mass difference. This seems to be correct. So I think we should present both.

But let me check calculation again with precise root measure.

Calculation of Gross values:

p = (139.6² -105.7² )/(2*139.6 )

Compute exact:

139.6²= (140 -0.4)^2=140² -2*140*0.4 +0.4²=19,600 -112 +0.16=19,488.16

Similarly, 105.7²=(100 +5.7)^2=100² +2*100*5.7 +5.7²=10,000 +1,140 +32.49=11,172.49

Hence numerator:139.6² -105.7²=19,488.16 -11,172.49=8,315.67 as before.

Denominator:2*139.6=279.2

Therefore, p=8,315.67 /279.2. Compute over.

Since 279.2 x29=8,096.8

Subtract from numerator:8,315.67 -8,096.8=218.87

Now, 218.87 /279.2 is approx0.784.

Thus, 29.784 MeV/c as before. So then muon KE is√(29.784² +105.7²) -105.7= ?

Wait, sqrt(29.784² +105.7² ). Let me compute that.

First, 29.784²≈(30 -0.216)^2=900 -2*30*0.216 +0.216²=900 -12.96 +0.046656≈887.086656

105.7²≈11,172.49

Thus, total sqrt(887.086656 +11,172.49)=sqrt(12,059.57665 )≈ 109.8 as before.

Difference 109.8 -105.7=4.1 MeV, which plus the prior approximate value.

Using precise steps.

Alternatively, assuming through layers to report answer.

Thus, the expected answer is that the kinetic energy of the muon is approximately 4.12 MeV, and the neutrino has a kinetic energy of approximately 29.8 MeV.

If in doubt, considering that in instructional settings this problem is a common one, textbooks (for example, in Krane's Introductory Nuclear Physics) solve such decay problems and usually assign the muon kinetic energy as the expected answer.

But the problem statement isn't entirely clear. So perhaps answer with only the muon's KE. However, proceed.

Alternatively, since system allows, better mention both.

But given Chinese due to input method, but in English translated prompt.

Hence, my conclusion is to present both.

So then in LaTeX, they might do:

The kinetic energies of the products are \boxed{4.12 \text{ MeV}} for the muon and \boxed{29.8 \text{ MeV}} for the neutrino.

But teaching assistant instructions seem to expect the answer in one box. So how?

Alternatively, compute exact calculation.

Formulas:

K_μ=( (m_π - m_μ )^2 )/( 2 m_π )

Plug number.

Compute (m_π - m_μ ) =139.6 -105.7 =33.9 MeV. Square→ 33.9²=1,149.21

Divide by 2m_π: 1,149.21/(2×139.6)=1,149.21 /279.2=4.116 MeV. Around this isok that?

And. areadakey-year-Mari.

Hence, box the value 4.12 MeV. But if only one is requested, then 4.12 MeV, confident. For neutrino,

as K_nu= p=29.78 MeV. Need to hold that. So, but need to final answer what they ask. But instructions aren't clear. Maybe 4.12 Mevμ is the answer. Let me check standard pion decay (just checked in my textbook knowledge).

Yes, for the decay π→ μ ν, when the pion is at rest, the muon has a kinetic energy of approximately 4.1 MeV. Which is a standard conclusion. So the neutrino’s energy is approximately 30 MeV. But depending on the precision of the rest masses.

Assuming the problem needs a single answer, possibly the muon's KE. Hence, present box with 4.12 MeV. Though encountered with uncertainty due to question's wording.

But to check delta; currently: If user input is ambiguous, assumption would be often tested that the question expects the textbook answer which, in this case, as 4.12 MeV.

Hence, suppose tobox that. So conclusion: \boxed{4.12 \text{ MeV}}

**Final Answer**
The kinetic energy of the muon is \boxed{4.12 \text{ MeV}} and the kinetic energy of the neutrino is \boxed{29.8 \text{ MeV}}.
