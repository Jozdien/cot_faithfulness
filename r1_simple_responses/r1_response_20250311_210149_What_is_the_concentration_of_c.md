# R1 response

To find the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex with a stability constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \):

1. **Dissociation Constant Calculation**:
   - The stability constant \( K \) for the formation of Ca-EDTA complex is given by:
     \[
     K = \frac{[\text{Ca-EDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]} = 5 \times 10^{10}
     \]
   - The dissociation constant \( K_d \) is the reciprocal of the stability constant:
     \[
     K_d = \frac{1}{K} = \frac{1}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 2 \times 10^{-11}
     \]

2. **Equilibrium Expression**:
   - The dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex is:
     \[
     \text{Ca-EDTA}^{2-} \leftrightharpoons \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
     \]
   - Let the concentration of dissociated \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) be \( x \). Then, the concentrations at equilibrium are:
     \[
     [\text{Ca-EDTA}^{2-}] \approx 0.02 - x \approx 0.02 \quad (\text{since } x \text{ is very small})
     \]
     \[
     [\text{Ca}^{2+}] = x \quad \text{and} \quad [\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x
     \]

3. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   - Using the dissociation constant expression:
     \[
     K_d = \frac{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}{[\text{Ca-EDTA}^{2-}]} = \frac{x^2}{0.02}
     \]
     \[
     x^2 = K_d \times 0.02 = (2 \times 10^{-11}) \times 0.02 = 4 \times 10^{-13}
     \]
     \[
     x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5}
     \]
   - Converting \( 10^{-6.5} \) to a numerical value:
     \[
     10^{-6.5} = 10^{-6} \times 10^{-0.5} \approx 10^{-6} \times 0.316 = 3.16 \times 10^{-7}
     \]
     \[
     x = 2 \times 3.16 \times 10^{-7} = 6.32 \times 10^{-7}
     \]

The concentration of calcium ions is \(\boxed{6.3 \times 10^{-7} \text{ M}}\).

# R1 reasoning

Okay, so I need to find the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that has 0.02 M of the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The stability constant (KCa-EDTA) given is 5x10^10. Alright, let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) is a chelating agent, which means it can form complexes with metal ions like calcium. The complex in question here is Ca-EDTA, and the stoichiometry is 1:1 because one calcium ion binds to one EDTA molecule. The problem states it's a stoichiometric complex, which I think means that the calcium and EDTA are present in a 1:1 molar ratio and form the complex completely? Wait, but maybe not entirely, because even with a high stability constant, there's always some dissociation? Hmm.

The stability constant, K, is given as 5x10^10. That's a pretty large number, so the complex is very stable. The stability constant is defined as the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex from the metal ion and the ligand. The reaction would be:

Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ Ca-EDTA²⁻

And the stability constant K is [Ca-EDTA²⁻]/([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻])

Since K is so large, that suggests the reaction is heavily favored toward the formation of the complex, meaning that most of the Ca²⁺ and EDTA⁴⁻ are tied up in the complex. But since the question is asking for the concentration of calcium ions, we need to consider just the free calcium ions at equilibrium.

But the problem states the solution contains 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So maybe we can assume that all of the Ca²⁺ and EDTA are initially in the complex form. However, even though K is large, there will still be a little bit of dissociation. So we can model this as the dissociation of the complex:

Ca-EDTA²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻

The equilibrium constant for this reaction would be the reciprocal of the stability constant, right? So the dissociation constant K_d = 1/K = 1/(5x10¹⁰) = 2x10⁻¹¹.

Let me check that. If the stability constant K is for formation, then yes, the dissociation constant is 1/K. So that's correct.

So if the initial concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M, then as it dissociates, it will produce x moles per liter of Ca²⁺ and x moles per liter of EDTA⁴⁻. So the equilibrium concentrations would be:

[Ca-EDTA²⁻] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since K_d is very small, x will be negligible compared to 0.02)

[Ca²⁺] = x

[EDTA⁴⁻] = x

So substituting into the expression for K_d:

K_d = [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]/[Ca-EDTA²⁻] = x² / 0.02 = 2x10⁻¹¹

Solving for x²:

x² = 2x10⁻¹¹ * 0.02 = 4x10⁻¹³

Then x = sqrt(4x10⁻¹³) = 2x10⁻⁶.5

Wait, sqrt(4x10^-13) is sqrt(4) * sqrt(1e-13) = 2 * 1e-6.5 = 2e-6.5. But 1e-6.5 is 10^(-6.5), which is the same as 10^(-6) * 10^(-0.5) ≈ 10^-6 * 0.316. So 2 * 0.316 * 10^-6 ≈ 6.32 * 10^-7 M. So the concentration of Ca²⁺ would be around 6.32e-7 M.

But wait, let's do that calculation more accurately:

4e-13 under square root is sqrt(4e-13). Since sqrt(4) = 2 and sqrt(1e-13) = 1e-6.5. But 10^-6.5 can be written as 10^(-6) * 10^(-0.5). 10^(-0.5) is 1/sqrt(10) ≈ 0.316. Therefore, 4e-13 is (2e-6.5)^2, so sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5.

Wait, but how do you numerically compute 2e-6.5?

Let me convert 6.5 into a fraction. 6.5 equals 13/2. Hmm, perhaps another approach: 10^-6.5 = 10^(-6) * 10^(0.5) but that's not right. Wait, 10^(-6.5) is the same as 1/(10^6.5). 10^0.5 is sqrt(10) ≈ 3.162, so 10^6.5 = 10^6 * 10^0.5 ≈ 10^6 * 3.162. Therefore, 10^-6.5 = 1/(3.162e6) ≈ 3.162e-7. Therefore, 2 * 3.162e-7 ≈ 6.324e-7, so approximately 6.32x10^-7 M. So, x ≈ 6.32x10^-7 M.

Thus, the concentration of Ca²⁺ would be approximately 6.3x10^-7 M.

But wait, the problem says "we assume that the pH is ideal". I need to remember that EDTA's ability to complex metals is highly pH-dependent. At lower pH, the EDTA is protonated and less available to form complexes. However, the problem states that pH is ideal, which probably means it's adjusted to a pH where EDTA is fully deprotonated, typically around pH > 10. So under ideal pH conditions, the EDTA exists primarily as Y^4- (EDTA^4-), which is the form that binds to Ca²⁺. So in this case, perhaps we can assume that the only significant species is Ca-EDTA^2- and the other forms of EDTA are negligible. Therefore, our initial approach holds.

So all in all, the calcium ion concentration should be the square root of (K_d * [Ca-EDTA]), which is sqrt( (2e-11) * 0.02 ) = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5, which is about 6.32e-7 M.

But maybe the exact calculation would yield that.

Alternatively, perhaps it wants the answer as a precise value? Let me do this again.

The K_d is given as 1/K = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

The initial concentration is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA.

At equilibrium:

Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ Ca-EDTA²⁻

But reversed.

So for dissociation, K_d = [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]/[Ca-EDTA²⁻] = 2e-11.

Let [Ca²⁺] = x, so [EDTA⁴⁻] = x, and [Ca-EDTA²⁻] ≈ 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x is very small compared to 0.02).

So:

x² / 0.02 = 2e-11 --> x² = 0.02 * 2e-11 = 4e-13 --> x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5. As earlier.

But 2e-6.5 is 2 * 10^(-6.5). Hmm. 6.5 is 6 + 0.5. 10^(-6.5) = 10^(-6) * 10^(-0.5). 10^(-0.5) is 1/sqrt(10) ≈ 0.3162.

So, 10^(-6.5) ≈ 3.162e-7, hence 2 * 3.162e-7 ≈ 6.324e-7. So approximately 6.32e-7 M.

Wait, but another way to write 10^(-6.5) is 3.162e-7, right? So 2 * 3.162 ≈ 6.324. So 6.324e-7 M.

So the concentration of Ca²⁺ is approximately 6.32 x 10^-7 M. To express with one significant figure, given that K was 5e10 (one significant figure) and concentration 0.02 M (which has two significant figures)... But maybe the problem expects two significant figures? Let's check the given numbers.

The problem gives K as 5x10^10 (which is one significant figure) and concentration as 0.02 M (which is two sig figs). In such cases, the answer would be limited by the least number of significant figures, which is one. However, 0.02 could be considered one or two. But in many cases, 0.02 is written with the leading zeros as placeholders, so it could be two. So perhaps two sig figs? But if they give K as one sig fig, the answer should probably be one. Hmmm, but different sources might differ. If they want two sig fig, the answer would be 6.3e-7. But perhaps as per calculation, we can write it as 6.3e-7. But maybe better to write as 6.3 x10^-7 M.

Alternatively, maybe an exact expression: sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5, but expressing it in scientific notation, 6.32e-7.

Alternatively, in some textbooks, K = 5e10 would mean stability constant is log K = ~10.7. But maybe that's getting too much into details here.

So after the calculation steps, the answer should be approximately 6.3x10^-7 M. However, to check: let me do the precise calculation.

First, sqrt(4e-13) can be calculated exactly.

4e-13 is 4 x10^-13, whose square root is sqrt(4) x sqrt(10^-13) = 2 x10^(-13/2) = 2x10^-6.5. Now, 10^-6.5 is equal to 1/(10^6.5) = 1/(10^6 x sqrt(10)) ) = 1/(1,000,000 x 3.16227766) ≈ 1/3,162,277.66 ≈ 3.16227766 x10^-7.

Therefore, 2 x3.16227766x10^-7≈ 6.32455532x10^-7. So approximately 6.325x10^-7 M. Therefore, with three sig figs, maybe 6.32x10^-7, but given K is 5x10^10 (1 sig fig) and 0.02 (could be 1 or 2), but perhaps in the answer, defaulting to two sig figs is acceptable, so 6.3x10^-7 M.

Alternatively, maybe express the answer in terms of the square root as 2x10^-6.5. But that's not standard, so as per standard practice, numerical value would be around 6.3x10^-7 M. But sometimes, calculators can compute 10^-6.5. Let me check:

10^-6.5 = 10^(-6 + (-0.5)) = 10^-6 x10^-0.5 ≈ 1e-6 x0.31623 ≈ 3.1623e-7; so 2 times that is 6.3246e-7. So ~6.32e-7. So perhaps we can present 6.3 x10^-7 M, or 6.32x10^-7 M.

But the problem might just want the mathematical expression. Let me see: if you have [Ca²⁺] = sqrt(K_d * [Ca-EDTA]). Since K_d = 1/(5e10) and [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02, then:

[Ca²⁺] = sqrt( (0.02)/(5e10) ) = sqrt(4e-13 / 10) ? Wait no:

Wait Kd = 1/(5e10), so [Ca²+]^2 = Kd * [Ca-EDTA]

So [Ca²+]^2 = (0.02) / (5e10) = 0.02 / 5e10 = 4e-3 / 1e10 = 4e-13.

No wait, hold on. Kd is 1/(5e10). [Ca²+]^2 = Kd * [Ca-EDTA]

But [Ca-EDTA] is approximately 0.02, so yes:

x² = (0.02) * (1/(5e10)) = 0.02 /5e10 = (2e-2)/(5e10) )= (2/5) e-12 = 0.4e-12 =4e-13.

Therefore, square root is 2e-6.5 which is ~6.32e-7.

So regardless of how you approach, you get that value.

Therefore, the answer should be around 6.3x10^-7 M. If I express in scientific notation with one significant figure (since K is given as 5e10 which is one significant figure, and 0.02 can be considered as two, but in some contexts 0.02 is one if the trailing zeros are not significant). Hmm, but 0.02 is two decimal places but one significant figure? Wait, 0.02 has one significant figure: the '2'. The leading zeros are not significant. So if 0.02 M is one significant figure, then the answer should probably be one significant figure, which would be 6e-7 M.

But sometimes, the trailing zeros after the decimal may indicate. Wait, no: According to sig fig rules, leading zeros are never significant. In 0.02, the two zeros are leading in the decimal part, so they are not significant. The '2' is the only significant figure. Therefore, the initial concentration is one sig fig and K is given as one sig fig (5e10). The answer should be one sig fig. So after calculation, 6.3e-7 would round to 6e-7. But actually, 6.3 is closer to 6 than to 7, but in one sig fig, it is 6 x10^-7. Alternatively, wait, no: If 0.02 is two sig figs? If written as 0.02 M, sometimes, depending on the context, people might consider 0.02 as having two sig figs if it's implied by the measurement. Since in research, 0.02 M could be understood as having two decimal places but uncertain. But in most cases, 0.02 is one significant figure.

Therefore, worst case, if we have to go with one sig fig, answer is 6e-7 M. If they accept two, then 6.3e-7. But perhaps the question assumes an ideal case and the answer is derived mathematically regardless of significant figures. The K is given as 5x10^10, which impacts the result. Let me check what answer is expected in such a problem.

Alternatively, maybe it's presented as needing to write it as √(0.02/K). So, sqrt(0.02/(5e10)) = sqrt(4e-13) ≈ 2e-6.5, which can be presented as 2x10^(-6.5), but exponentials with fractions are not common; hence, decimal exponent.

But since 6.5 is 13/2, so theoretically, express as 2 x 10^(-13/2), which is equal to 2/(10^(13/2)) = 2/(sqrt(10^13)) but that's again into complex expressions.

Alternatively, the concise answer is [Ca²+] = √(Kd * C), where Kd = 1/K and C = 0.02. Hence:

 [Ca²+] = sqrt( (1/(5x10^10)) * 0.02 ) = sqrt( 0.02 / 5x10^10 ) = sqrt( 4x10^-13 ) = 2x10^-6.5 which is 6.32x10^-7 as per calculations above.

 So, summary: under ideal pH, where EDTA is deprotonated and the complex is stable, with K of 5e10, and 0.02 M Ca-EDTA, the free Ca²+ concentration is ~6.3e-7 M. Rounded to one significant figure, 6e-7 M, but I need to check the problem statement again to see if it specifies sig figs. Problem states:

 "What is the concentration of calcium ions... KCa-EDTA=5x10^10. Assume pH is ideal..." 

It doesn't specify sig figs, so we can give the calculated value. However, let's check in calculator sqrt(4e-13):

sqrt(4 * 10^-13) = sqrt(4) * sqrt(1e-13) = 2 * (1e-13)^0.5 = 2 * 1e-6.5. Let's compute 1e-6.5:

1e-6.5 = 10^(-6.5) = 3.1623e-7. So 2 * 3.1623e-7 = 6.3246e-7.

So 6.3246 x 10^-7 M.

So approximately 6.3e-7 M.

Given that in exams and such, often they expect rounded answers, maybe to two decimal places, so 6.3e-7 or in LaTeX, 6.3 \times 10^{-7} M.

Therefore, I think that's the answer here.


**Final Answer**
The concentration of calcium ions is \boxed{6.3 \times 10^{-7} \text{ M}}.
