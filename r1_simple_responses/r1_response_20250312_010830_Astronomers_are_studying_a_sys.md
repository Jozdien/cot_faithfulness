# Original Question

Astronomers are studying a system of three exoplanets (Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3) with circular orbits discovered through the TTV method. They have found that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 2.3. They have also found that the ratio of the masses between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 1.35. By what factor is the orbital period of Planet3 larger than that of Planet1, if the albedo for all three planets is equal to 0.3 (similar to that of Earth)?

Okay, so the problem is about finding the ratio of the orbital periods of Planet3 to Planet1, given some ratios of their equilibrium temperatures and masses. All the planets have the same albedo as Earth, which is 0.3. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, equilibrium temperature. I remember the formula for equilibrium temperature of a planet is related to the stellar luminosity, the distance from the star (which would be the orbital radius), and the albedo. The formula is something like T_equilibrium = ( ( L * (1 - albedo) ) / (16 * π² * σ * D² ) )^(1/4), where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant and D is the distance from the star. Wait, but maybe more accurately, the equilibrium temperature formula is T = [ (L (1 - a) ) / (16 π² σ D²) ]^(1/4). Let me check that again. Yeah, I think that's right. Since the star's luminosity L is the same for all planets (they orbit the same star, right?), and albedo a is given as the same for all three planets. So the equilibrium temperature ratio between two planets should depend on the inverse square root of their orbital distances. Because in the formula, T is proportional to (L (1 - a)/D²)^(1/4). So splitting out the variables, T is proportional to (L)^(1/4) * (1 - a)^(1/4) / D^(1/2). Since L and (1 - a) are the same for all planets because same star and same albedo, then T is inversely proportional to the square root of D. So Ti / Tj = sqrt(Dj / Di). Wait, let's verify that. If you take Ti / Tj = [ (1/Di²) / (1/Dj²) ) ]^(1/4) = (Dj² / Di²)^(1/4) = (Dj/Di)^(1/2). So Ti / Tj = sqrt(Dj / Di)? So, if Ti is hotter (higher temperature) than Tj, then Dj must be larger? Wait, no. Wait, if Dj is larger, then Ti/Tj would be sqrt(larger/smaller)? Wait, suppose Di is the distance of planet i, Dj of planet j. Ti / Tj = sqrt(Dj / Di). So if Ti > Tj, then sqrt(Dj / Di) > 1, meaning Dj > Di. So a closer planet (smaller D) would have a higher temperature, which makes sense. So yeah, that works. Therefore, T is inversely proportional to sqrt(D). 

So given the temperature ratios between planets, we can relate their orbital distances. The problem gives us T1/T2 = 1.4 and T2/T3 = 2.3. Let's check: given T1/T2 = 1.4, so that's T1 = 1.4 T2. According to the formula, T1/T2 = sqrt(D2/D1), so 1.4 = sqrt(D2/D1). Therefore, squaring both sides, D2/D1 = 1.96. Which would mean D2 is 1.96 times D1. Similarly, T2/T3 = 2.3. So sqrt(D3/D2) = 2.3, so D3/D2 = (2.3)^2 = 5.29. Thus, D3 is 5.29 times D2. So then D3 would be 5.29 * 1.96 * D1. Let me compute that. 5.29 * 1.96. Let me compute 5 * 1.96 is 9.8, 0.29 * 1.96 is approx 0.5684. So total 9.8 + 0.5684 = approx 10.3684. So D3 ≈10.3684 D1. Therefore, D3 is about 10.37 times D1. But this is about the distance.

But we need to find the orbital period ratio, P3/P1. To find that, we can use Kepler's third law. For circular orbits around the same star, the orbital period squared is proportional to the semi-major axis (which is the orbital radius) cubed. So (P3 / P1)^2 = (D3 / D1)^3, so P3/P1 = (D3/D1)^(3/2). So if D3/D1 is approx 10.37, then take that to the 3/2 power. But let's compute exactly: the D ratios from the temperatures. Wait, let me re-express all of this step by step.

Given:
T1 / T2 = 1.4 => D2/D1 = (T1 / T2)^2 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96.

T2 / T3 = 2.3 => D3/D2 = (T2 / T3)^2 = (2.3)^2 = 5.29.

Therefore, D3/D1 = D3/D2 * D2/D1 = 5.29 * 1.96.

Let me compute that. 5.29 * 1.96.

First, 5 * 1.96 = 9.8

Then 0.29 * 1.96. Let's compute:

0.2 * 1.96 = 0.392

0.09 * 1.96 = 0.1764

So total 0.392 + 0.1764 = 0.5684.

Therefore, total is 9.8 + 0.5684 = 10.3684.

So D3 = 10.3684 D1.

Then using P3/P1 = (D3/D1)^(3/2) = (10.3684)^(3/2).

So first, take the square root of 10.3684, then cube it. Or compute 10.3684^(1.5). Yeah.

Compute sqrt(10.3684). Let me compute. 10.3684. The square root of 9 is 3, sqrt(16)=4. So sqrt(10.3684). Let's try 3.2^2=10.24. 3.2 squared is 10.24. 3.2^2=10.24. Then 3.21^2 = 10.24 + 2*3.2*0.01 + (0.01)^2=10.24 + 0.064 +0.0001=10.3041. 3.22^2=3.2^2 + 2*3.2*0.02 + 0.02^2=10.24 +0.128 +0.0004=10.3684. Oh, so sqrt(10.3684)=3.22. No way, 3.22 squared is 10.3684?

Yes:

3.22 * 3.22:

Calculate 3 * 3 = 9, 3 * 0.22 * 2 = 1.32, 0.22 * 0.22 =0.0484.

So total that's (9 + 1.32 + 0.0484) + other terms. Wait, the actual multiplication would be:

300 * 3.22 =

Wait, maybe better:

3.22 *3.22:

= (3 +0.22)(3 + 0.22)

= 9 + 0.66 + 0.66 +0.0484

=9 +1.32 +0.0484=10.3684.

Yes! So sqrt(10.3684)=3.22. So (10.3684)^(3/2)= (3.22)^3.

So 3.22 cubed:

First compute 3 cubed=27.

Then compute 3^2 *0.22*3= 9*0.22*3=27*0.22=5.94.

Then 3*(0.22)^2 *3=9*(0.22)^2.

Wait, maybe it's easier to calculate 3.22 *3.22 =10.3684, then multiply by 3.22 again.

10.3684 *3.22.

Compute 10 *3.22 =32.2, 0.3684 *3.22≈1.186.

So total≈32.2 +1.186≈33.386.

Wait, let's do it precise:

10.3684 *3.22:

Breakdown:

10 *3.22 =32.2

0.3 *3.22 =0.966

0.06 *3.22=0.1932

0.0084 *3.22=0.027048

Add them up: 32.2 + 0.966 =33.166; 33.166 +0.1932=33.3592; 33.3592+0.027048≈33.3862.

Therefore, 10.3684^(3/2)=33.3862.

Therefore, P3/P1≈33.39. So roughly a factor of ~33.4 times longer orbital period than Planet1. Is that feasible?

But wait, according to the previous steps, T1/T2=1.4, meaning Planet1 is hotter than Planet2, so Planet2 is farther from the star, so D2=1.96 D1. Then Planet3 is even farther, D3=5.29 D2=10.37 D1. So according to Kepler's law, period cubed, or (D)^3 ~ P^2. So yes, (10.37/1)^(3/2)=~33.3 or so, so 33. X. That seems okay.

But wait, the problem also mentions mass ratios. They said the ratio of the masses between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15, and between Planet2 and Planet3 is about 1.35. Hmm, why is the mass ratio given? Because the question is about the orbital periods. In Kepler's law, the period depends on the semi-major axis and the mass of the star, not the mass of the planet. Unless the planets are so massive that the star's motion is significant, but in most exoplanet cases, the planet mass is negligible compared to the star. Unless they're using some other method where planetary mass affects the TTV (transit timing variation), so perhaps the method they discovered the planets with, which is TTV. But TTV is used to infer masses and other orbital parameters. But the question here is about equilibrium temperatures and then the periods. Wait, maybe given that they were detected with TTV, but but now they've already found the masses, and maybe the mass relates to the gravitational interactions. Hmmm.

But the problem statement is: by what factor is the orbital period of Planet3 larger than that of Planet1, given the temperature ratios and mass ratios, with albedo 0.3.

Wait a second, the arrival after giving the temperature ratios and mass ratios. So maybe the mass ratios have to be taken into account?

But in equilibrium temperature, the mass shouldn't directly matter. Equilibrium temperature depends on the distance, albedo, and star's luminosity. Unless the planet's mass affects the temperature through some other way... Maybe if you have a more massive planet, it can retain atmosphere differently, perhaps changing the greenhouse effect or something, which would influence the temperature, but the equilibrium temperature formula typically disregards that. It's a basic formula where albedo is a parameter. But the problem states that the albedo is the same for all, so that the differences in temperature would come solely from the distance. So that even if a planet is larger or more massive, if the albedo is the same, then the equilibrium temperature would only relate to the star's luminosity and distance. Therefore, does the mass ratio affect anything here? Maybe in the orbital period through some other relationship?

Wait, Kepler's third law in the Newtonian form is P² = (4π²/G(M + m)) * a³, where M is the star's mass, m is the planet's mass. But typically, if the planet's mass is much less than the star's mass, then M + m ≈ M, so planet mass m is neglected. However, if the problem is considering the planet masses, maybe they are significant? But in the question, they give only mass ratios between the planets, not their absolute masses. Since for all three planets, they would each have their own mass, but since their masses ratio are given as 1.15 and1.35. So M1/M2=1.15, meaning M1=1.15 M2; M2/M3=1.35, so M2=1.35 M3, thus M1=1.15 *1.35 M3≈1.55 M3.

But if the mass of the planet is much less than the star, even if the planets are Jupiters, the star (like a solar mass) is about 10^3 times more massive than a Jupiter. So for Earth-like planets, even more so. So even if Planet1 is 1.5 times Planet3's mass, but both are negligible compared to the star, then Kepler's law shouldn't require the planetary mass. However, did the problem state the star's mass? Hmm. No, not given. So maybe we can assume that the Keplerian period depends only on the semi-major axis (i.e., distances D1, D2, D3) and the star's mass. But since all three planets are orbiting the same star, then P³ / a³ depends only on the star's mass.

Therefore, if Planet1 and Planet3 have semi-major axes (distances) D1 and D3, then P3 / P1 = (D3/D1)^(3/2) / (M_star / M_star ) is the same. So star's mass cancels out. Therefore, the ratio just depends on distance. So given that, even if the planetary masses are different, they don't affect the orbital periods in this approximation.

But the issue is that the question is about transiting timing variations. TTV method involves variations in the timing of transits caused by gravitational interactions between planets. Therefore, the mass of the planets could influence the TTVs, which is how they were detected. But once the orbital periods are established, they are determined by
