# Original Question

You have an interesting drought-resistant cultivar of barley, which, unfortunately, contains an anti-nutritional compound. This compound makes it impossible to use this cultivar for food purposes. After an extensive investigation, you discover the gene responsible for the synthesis of this compound. This gene consists of five exons and four introns. You decide to use old-school approaches and produce a collection of mutants using EMS chemical mutagen. You sequence a target gene in all mutant lines and discover some changes at the beginning of its sequence in the first exon area. Which of the following mutations will most probably let you eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the cultivar?

Intact gene:
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Mutant 2:
5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Mutant 3:
5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Mutant 4:
5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’<b>

# R1 reasoning

Alright, let's tackle this genetics problem. So, the question is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that produces an anti-nutritional compound because of a specific gene. The goal is to find out which of the four mutant lines would most likely eliminate this compound. The gene has five exons and four introns, and the mutations are in the first exon area. 

First, let me recall some basics. EMS (ethyl methanesulfonate) is a chemical mutagen that typically causes point mutations, usually by alkylating guanine, leading to transitions—like changing G to A or C to T. These mutations are typically missense or nonsense if in exons, or splice site mutations if in introns. Since the mutations here are in the first exon, we probably don't have to worry about splicing issues here; it's more likely a coding region change.

The original gene sequence given is:

5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Let me transcribe this into the coding DNA strand, which is the same as the mRNA except with T instead of U. The mRNA would be read by the ribosome in triplets (codons) starting at ATG (the start codon). So translating the original sequence step by step:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA

Breaking that down into codons:

ATG = Methionine (start)
TTT = Phenylalanine (F)
CTC = Leucine (L)
GCT = Alanine (A)
GGT = Glycine (G)
ACT = Threonine (T)
TCT = Serine (S)
GTG = Valine (V)
GAT = Aspartic acid (D)
GAA = Glutamic acid (E)
CAT = Histidine (H)
ATT = Isoleucine (I)
TAT = Tyrosine (Y)
TGT = Cysteine (C)
CGT = Arginine (R)
... and so on until TGA (stop).

So the protein starts with Met-F-L-A-G-T-S-V-D-E-H-I-Y-C-R... until the stop codon.

Now, the problem is which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. That means the gene's product (the protein) is probably the enzyme responsible for synthesizing this compound. So if the gene is mutated in a way that the protein is non-functional, the compound won't be produced. This could happen through a nonsense mutation (premature stop codon), a frameshift mutation leading to a completely altered amino acid sequence and possibly premature stop, or a critical missense mutation that disrupts enzyme function.

Looking at each mutant line:

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Comparing to original:
Original: TTT CTC GCT ...
Mutant 1: TCT ACG CT...
Wait, let me line them up properly:

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...
Mutant1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT...
So the original first few nucleotides are ATG TTT CTC GCT...
Mutant1 is ATG TTC TAC GCT...

Actually, breaking down the nucleotide changes:

Original sequence starting at the beginning: Position 4-6 is TTT (codon 2). Let's index the original sequence from ATG as bases 1-3 (ATG), then 4-6 (TTT), 7-9 (CTC), 10-12 (GCT), etc.

In Mutant1: The first few nucleotides are ATG TTC TAC GCT... So comparing codons:

Codon2: original TTT (F) becomes TTC. That's a synonymous mutation because TTT and TTC both code for phenylalanine. So no change here.

Codon3: Original CTC (L) becomes TAC. Wait, how?

Wait, let's check the actual DNA sequences. Original: 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT... so positions 7-9 are CTC.

Mutant1: after ATG, TTC at positions 4-6 (which is codon2). Then positions 7-9: TAC. So in the original, position7 is C (third base of codon2?), no. Wait, I need to be more precise.

Let me write out the original sequence as a continuous string (ignore the apostrophe and the numbers for clarity):

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA

Mutant1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC ... TGA

So, comparing each codon:

Codon1: ATG (same, Met)
Codon2: TTT (F) vs TTC (F) → same amino acid.
Codon3: Original CTC (L) vs Mutant TAC (Y)? Wait, because in mutant1, the third codon is TAC. So let's check the nucleotides. Original third codon is CTC (positions7-9), which is complementary to GAG in the template strand. But wait, the DNA is given as 5’ to 3’. In mRNA, it would be the same as the coding strand, except T becomes U.

But in the DNA, codon3 is CTC (Leucine). In the mutant1, the third codon becomes TAC. Wait, TAC on the coding DNA strand would correspond to TAC in mRNA as UAC, which is Tyrosine (Y). So codon3 mutation: CTC → TAC. Wait, how did that happen? Let's see the actual DNA change.

Looking at the first part:

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...

Mutant1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT...

So the original had TTT then CTC GCT. The mutant changed the TTT to TTC (no amino acid change, still Phe), then the next nucleotides were changed: original T (position7?), then in CTC to TAC. Wait, perhaps the third codon is being altered. Let's index the original:

Positions 1-3: ATG
4-6: TTT (codon2)
7-9: CTC (codon3)
10-12: GCT (codon4)
13-15: GGT (codon5)
etc.

In mutant1, the codons after codon2 (TTC) are:

Position7-9: TAC. So, original CTC (positions7-9) in DNA is changed to TAC. Let's write CTC vs TAC. What's the nucleotide change? Let's look at each base:

CTC: C at position7, T at 8, C at9.

TAC: T at7, A at8, C at9.

So, position7: C→T (transition or transversion?), position8: T→A (transversion), position9 remains C. Wait, but that would be two changes in the same codon: C at position7 becomes T, T at position8 becomes A. How does that happen? EMS usually causes point mutations, not multiple changes. Hmm, but in any case, the amino acid changes from Leu (CTC) to Tyr (TAC on DNA, so mRNA is UAC). So the third amino acid is changed from Leu to Tyr. That's a missense mutation. Could affect protein function if this residue is important, maybe in the active site. But if not, maybe the protein is still functional.

Mutant1 also has a change towards the end: ...TGTCGC instead of ...TGTCGT. Let's check that part.

Original: ...TGT CGT (codons: Cysteine (TGT) and Arginine (CGT)).

Mutant1: ...TGT CGC (CGC is also Arginine). So that's a synonymous mutation; no change. So that mutation is probably silent.

So, Mutant1 has a silent mutation in codon2 (F), a missense mutation in codon3 (L→Y), and a silent mutation in some later codon. Whether this disrupts the protein enough to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound depends on the role of codon3. Without more info, it's possible but not certain.

Mutant 2:
5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT ... 

Mutant2: ATG TTC TAA GCT ...

Breaking down the codons:

Codon2: TTT → TTC (F, same)
Codon3: original CTC → TAA (which in DNA is TAA. On mRNA, UAA, which is a stop codon)

Oh! So codon3 in Mutant2 is a stop codon. That would cause premature termination. The protein would be just Met-Phe (from codon1 and 2) followed by a stop. So a very truncated protein. If the anti-nutritional compound's synthesis requires the full-length enzyme, this would eliminate it. This is a nonsense mutation in the third codon. Since it's in exon1, early in the gene, the protein is severely truncated. That's likely to abolish function. So Mutant2 introduces a premature stop codon, making the gene product non-functional. That seems like a strong candidate.

Mutant3:
5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Original: ATG TTT TCT CGC TGG TAC TTC TGT...
Wait, original is ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG... Let me parse.

Original first exon:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Mutant3: ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG ...

Wait, the original sequence is ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT

So mutant3 changes CTC (codon3) to TAC (same as Mutant1?), but then maybe some other changes. Let's look carefully.

Original: Codon1: ATG, Codon2:TTC to TTT? Wait, the original's second codon is TTT (positions4-6). Mutant3's second codon is still TTT (same as original?), but then looking at the third codon: original CTC vs. Mutant3: TAC?

Wait, maybe I need to index the nucleotides.

Original sequence from the first few:

ATG (1-3), TTT (4-6), CTC (7-9), GCT (10-12), GGT (13-15), ACT (16-18), TCT (19-21), etc.

Mutant3's sequence:

ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT...

Compare:

After ATG:

Original: positions4-6: TTT (codon2, same in mutant3)
positions7-9: original CTC (codon3) vs mutant3: TAC (codon3)
positions10-12: GCT (codon4, same)
positions13-15: GGT (codon5, same) but wait, in mutant3 is it GGTGTC...?

Wait, mutant3's sequence is:

ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT...

Wait, original codon5 is GGT. But in mutant3, after codon4 GCT (positions10-12 in original), then codon5 is GGT (13-15) becomes GGT? Wait, maybe there's an insertion?

Wait, original sequence after codon4 (GCT): GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Mutant3: After codon4 GCT, GGT GTC ACT TCT... So original codon5 is GGT (Gly), but codon6 was ACT (Thr), but in mutant3, codon5 GGT is same, then codon6 is GTC (Val) instead of ACT. How's that possible? Let me check the actual nucleotide alignment.

Original from codon4 onwards:

GCT (codon4) GGT ACT TCT GTG → GCT is first, then GGT (codon5), ACT (codon6), TCT (codon7), etc.

In mutant3: After GCT (codon4), it's GGT GTC ACT TCT...

So original codon5: GGT (positions13-15)
Original codon6: ACT (16-18)
In mutant3, codon5: GGT (same), codon6: GTC (positions16-18 changed from ACT to GTC)

ACT to GTC would require changing all three nucleotides? ACT in original, GTC in mutant3. Let me see:

A (position16) → G, C (17) → T, T(18) remains C?

Wait, no: Original DNA sequence for codon6 (ACT):

A at position16, C at17, T at18.

Mutant3's codon6 is GTC:

G at16, T at17, C at18.

So, positions16: A→G, position17: C→T, position18: T→C. Wait, that's three nucleotide changes in the same codon. That seems unlikely with EMS mutagenesis, which typically causes point mutations. But perhaps it's possible? Alternatively, maybe there's a deletion or insertion that causes a frameshift.

Wait, looking back at the original sequences provided:

Original: 
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant3:
5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Comparing to original:

Starting after ATG:

Original: TTT CT C GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG ...
Mutant3: TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG ...

Wait, perhaps there's a insertion? Let's count letters. Original from ATG onwards:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Mutant3: ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Hmm, insertion of TAC replacing CTC? Or maybe a deletion? Let me check. The original here after the first TTT (positions4-6) is CTC (positions7-9) and then GCT (positions10-12).

Mutant3 after TTT (positions4-6) is TAC (positions7-9), then GCT (positions10-12), then GGT (13-15), but original GGT is followed by ACT (16-18) while Mutant3 has GGT GTC ACT...

Wait, ACT is codon6, original is ACT (positions16-18), Mutant3 has GTC in place of ACT for codon6? So codon6 in original was ACT (Thr), which is now GTC (Val). That’s an missense mutation. But how did codon6 change from ACT to GTC? That would require three nucleotide changes: A→G, C→T, and T→C? That seems highly unlikely. Unless there's a frameshift or something causing a larger change.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a duplication or a deletion. Looking closer at the sequence:

Original: ...GGT ACT TCT GTG...
Mutant3: ...GGTGTCACT TCT...

Wait, expanding the DNA sequences into the original and mutant.

Looking at original sequence around that area:

Original:

exon area starts with ATG... then the part after:

after the start: TTTCTC GCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Mutant3 shows:

TTTTAC GCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGAT...

Comparing the DNA:

Original snippet:TTTCTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Mutant3 snippet: TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG...

Wait, actually in Mutant3, there's a T insertion in the first part? Let's count nucleotides:

Original:

ATG T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T...

Mutant3: 

ATG T T T T A C G C T G G T G T C A C T T C T G T G G A T...

Hmm, so there's an extra T somewhere? Or is there a change from TTT CTC to TTT TAC? So positions7-9 in original are CTC, changed to TAC (as in Mutant1 and Mutant2?), but perhaps with more changes downstream.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in parsing. Let's write both sequences:

Original:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG ... 

Mutant3:

ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG ... 

So between TTT and GCT, Original has CTC (positions7-9), mutant3 has TAC (positions7-9). Then GCT is same. Then GGT (positions13-15) same. After GGT, original has ACT (codon6), mutant3 has GTC (codon6), then ACT (codon7?), maybe...

Wait, but the original ACT (positions16-18) changed to GTC in mutant3. That's three mutations in codon6? Changing ACT (Thr) to GTC (Val). But how? Each nucleotide: A→G at position16, C→T at17, T→C at18. That's three changes, which would be a very rare event. Since EMS causes point mutations, perhaps this question is suggesting a possible frameshift?

Alternately, maybe the sequence for Mutant3 has a different arrangement. Let me check again:

Original fragment:5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant3:5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Comparing:

Original: CT-C-GCT-GGT-ACT...

Mutant3: TAC-GCT-GGT-GTC-ACT...

Wait, maybe there's an insertion of a T in the TTT? Original is TTT (positions4-6: T, T, T. Mutant3: TTTT (positions4-7: T, T, T, T)? Wait, let's count letters:

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...

That's ATG then three T's (TTT), then CTC (three bases), GCT (three), GGT (three), ACT (three), etc.

Mutant3: ATG TTTT ACG CTG GTG TCA CTT ... 

Wait, maybe the TTT in original (positions4-6) becomes TTTT in mutant3 (positions4-7). That would be adding an extra T, which would be a frameshift mutation. Oh! Wait, that's possible. For example, in original, positions4-6: TTT (codon2), then positions7-9: CTC.

In mutant3, if there's an insertion of an extra T, so the sequence becomes TTTT. So codon2 would be TTT and the insertion makes it T T T T, so the frameshift starts there. Let me verify:

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...

Codon1: ATG, codon2: TTT, codon3: CTC, codon4: GCT, codon5: GGT, codon6: ACT, etc.

Mutant3: starts as ATG TTTT ACG CTG GTG TCA...

So after ATG, there's four T's: TTTT. So the codons would shift:

codon2: TTT (if we read three: positions4-6), but with a T added, perhaps the reading frame is shifted.

Wait, insertion of one T would make the sequence TTTT at positions4-7 (original positions4-6 are TTT; inserting a T after position6 would give TTTT). Then, the codons would be:

ATG (codon1), TTT (codon2), TAC (codon3: TT becomes TT_ becoming TTA (for codon3: TAC is actually part of that?) No, maybe it's tricky.

Alternatively, inserting a T at position7 (the first base of codon3) would shift the reading frame.

Wait, original codon3 is CTC (positions7-9). Inserting a T after position6 (after the first three T's) makes positions4
