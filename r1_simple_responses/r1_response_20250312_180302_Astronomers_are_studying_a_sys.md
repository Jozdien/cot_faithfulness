# Original Question

Astronomers are studying a system of five exoplanets with circular orbits, discovered through the TTV method. The planets (designated as Planet_1 through Planet_5), which are in orbital resonance, have orbital periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Assuming these planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2?

To find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we start by noting that their orbital periods are given in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Since the planets have the same albedo and orbit the same star, the equilibrium temperature depends on the orbital distance. 

Using Kepler's third law, the orbital period \( P \) is related to the distance \( D \) from the star by \( P^2 \propto D^3 \), leading to \( D \propto P^{2/3} \). The equilibrium temperature \( T \) is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance, so \( T \propto D^{-1/2} \). Substituting the relationship for \( D \), we get \( T \propto P^{-1/3} \).

Given the periods for Planet_4 and Planet_2 are 3.5 and 2 respectively, the ratio of their temperatures is:
\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \left( \frac{P_2}{P_4} \right)^{1/3}
\]
Substituting the periods, \( P_2 = 2 \) and \( P_4 = 3.5 = \frac{7}{2} \), we get:
\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \left( \frac{2}{3.5} \right)^{1/3} = \left( \frac{4}{7} \right)^{1/3}
\]

Thus, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is \boxed{\left( \dfrac{4}{7} \right)^{\frac{1}{3}}}.

# R1 reasoning

Alright, so I need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. Both planets are part of a system with five exoplanets in orbital resonance, and their orbital periods are given in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Since they were discovered via the TTV method, which usually means there are transit timing variations due to gravitational interactions, but I don't know if that affects the equilibrium temperature. The question mentions they have the same albedo, so that's a key point. 

First, equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on several factors. Let me recall the formula. The equilibrium temperature is related to the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the albedo. The formula, if I remember correctly, comes from balancing the incoming stellar radiation with the outgoing blackbody radiation. 

The formula is T = [ ( L (1 - a) ) / (16 π σ D² ) ]^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, a is the albedo, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and D is the distance from the star. Since all the planets are orbiting the same star, L is constant. They have the same albedo, so (1 - a) is the same for both. The constants π and σ are obviously constants. So the temperature really just depends on 1 / D² under the fourth root. Therefore, T ∝ 1 / D^(1/2). 

But wait, orbital periods are given. To relate the period to the distance, we need to use Kepler's third law. Kepler's third law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (which is the distance for circular orbits). So, P² ∝ D³. Therefore, D ∝ P^(2/3). If we substitute that into the temperature formula, since D is proportional to P^(2/3), then T ∝ 1 / (P^(2/3))^(1/2) = 1 / P^(1/3). So Temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period. 

Is that right? Let's step through that again. 

Starting from Kepler's third law: P² = (4 π² / (G M)) D³, where M is the mass of the star. So D is proportional to P^(2/3). Then, the equilibrium temperature formula, which is T = [ ( L (1 - a) ) / (16 π σ D² ) ]^(1/4). So inserting D ∝ P^(2/3), then D² ∝ P^(4/3). Therefore, D² is proportional to P^(4/3). Then plugging into temperature: T ∝ [ 1 / (D²) ]^(1/4) = [ 1 / P^(4/3) ]^(1/4) = P^(-4/3 * 1/4) = P^(-1/3). So T is proportional to P^(-1/3), which is the same as T ∝ 1 / P^(1/3). 

Yeah, so that's correct. Therefore, the equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet 4 and Planet 2 would be (T4 / T2) = (P2 / P4)^(1/3). 

Now, checking the periods: the ratio of periods is given as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 for Planets 1 through 5, right? So Planet_4 has a period of 3.5, and Planet_2 has a period of 2. So T4/T2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3). 

But let's confirm the ordering. The planet numbers are 1 to 5, and the periods are 1, 2, 2.5, 3.5, 5. So yes, that's in order. Planet_1 has period 1, Planet_2: 2, Planet_3: 2.5, Planet_4: 3.5, Planet_5:5.

Therefore, planet 4 period is 3.5, planet 2 period is 2. So their temperature ratio is (3.5 / 2)^(-1/3) = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3). Hmm, maybe simplifying that.

Wait 3.5 is 7/2, so let's see, 3.5 = 7/2. So (2 / (7/2)) = 4/7. So the ratio would be (4/7)^(1/3), which is equivalent to (cube root of 4)/(cube root of 7). Alternatively, in fractional exponents, 4^(1/3)/7^(1/3).

But if they want the ratio as an exact ratio maybe in terms of numbers?

Alternatively, if the period ratio between planet2 and planet4 is 2:3.5, but in Kelvin temperatures, which ratio is that. Wait, the temperature ratio is T4 / T2, which equal to (P2 / P4)^{1/3} = (2 / 3.5)^{1/3} math.

But let's check again. From the formula, T ∝ 1/P^{1/3}, so T1/T2 = (P2 / P1)^{1/3}. Therefore, T4/T2 = (P2 / P4)^{1/3} = (2 / 3.5)^{1/3}.

Therefore, the ratio is the cube root of (2/3.5).

But they may want it in terms of the ratio as numbers. Alternatively, to express this with rational numbers. Let's see.

First, 2:3.5 can be written as 4:7 if multiply both numerator and denominator by 2. So, 4/7. Therefore, the cube root of (4/7). Alternatively, 4^(1/3)/7^(1/3). So that would be the exact ratio. Since 4 is 2^2, so cube root of 4 is 2^(2/3), and 7^(1/3).

But they are not perfect cubes, so we can’t simplify it further. So, perhaps unless there is another way. Wait, perhaps factors for the periods.

But are the periods given as in ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5? 1, 2, 2.5, 3.5, 5. This seems decimal. 1, 2, 5/2, 7/2, 5. Are they in integer ratios if scaled? Let's confirm. Multiply all numbers by 2: 2, 4, 5, 7,10. So, 2:4:5:7:10. Are these integers. So it's possible that the ratio can be expressed as 2:4:5:7:10. Which is to the original periods just scaling by a factor of 2. Since all the periods in the systems can be scaled by any constant. So unless the actual periods are in terms of days or years, which we aren't told.

Therefore, their ratio is indeed 1:2:2.5:3.5:5, which scaled up to integers by multiplying by 2 is 2:4:5:7:10. But the ratios between planets 2 and 4 would still be 4 and 14 when scaled up by 2, wait: original planet2 is 2, planet4 is 3.5, so when scaled by 2, they become 4 and 7. Therefore, the ratio between planet2 and planet4 periods when scaled is 4 to 7, so 4:7. Therefore, their period ratio is 4:7. 

Therefore, the temperature ratio is (4/7)^{-1/3} = (7/4)^{1/3}. Wait, sorry. Wait, temp is proportional to 1 / P^{1/3}. So if T4 is the temperature of planet4 and P4 = 7 (in scaled units), and T2 is temperatureof planet2, P2=4. Therefore, T4/T2 = (P2 / P4)^{1/3} = (4/7)^{1/3}. 

So that is the cube root of (4/7). Okay, which is the final ratio. But how would they present this? Maybe written as the ratio of temperatures \boxed{\left(\dfrac{4}{7}\right)^{1/3}}. Alternatively, rationalizing, perhaps trying to approximate the cube roots numerically.

Wait, maybe there is a way to express this using Kepler's law. But no, the problem doesn't give actual periods, just ratios. So maybe we can even just write in terms of period ratios. The question says, 'the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2.' So Planet_4 has a longer orbital period, meaning it is farther from the star, right? Because period increases with distance. So since planet_4 is farther, its equilibrium temperature should be lower. Therefore, the ratio T4/T2 should be less than 1. So (4/7)^(1/3). Which is approximately (0.5714)^(1/3). The cube root of 0.5714. Let's compute that roughly. 

Cube root of 0.5714. Hmmm. 

Since 0.5714 is approximately 4/7.

Cube root of 4 ≈ 1.5874

Cube root of 7 ≈ 1.913

So 1.5874 / 1.913 ≈ 0.83.

So approximately 0.83, or  (4/7)^(1/3). But the question asks for the ratio, so it's probably acceptable to leave it in the exponent form, unless they want a numerical ratio. But in a standardized test problem, they might want exact form. For physics problems, exponents with fractional powers are acceptable unless told otherwise. 

Since the problem mentions they have the same albedo, so albedo cancels out. But all being in the same system, same star, so yes. So the entire derivation seems to check out.

Let me verify once again.

Start with equilibrium temperature formula:

T = [ (L (1 - a) ) / (16 π σ D²) ]^(1/4)

So T ∝ D^(-1/2)

Because D is in the denominator squared, powered to 1/4.

But then, Kepler's law:

P² ∝ D³ ==> D ∝ P^(2/3)

Therefore, D^(-1/2) = (P^(2/3))^(-1/2) = P^(-1/3)

Thus, T ∝ P^(-1/3)

Therefore, yes. T4/T2 = (P2/P4)^(1/3)

Since temperature is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so the ratio (T4/T2) is (P2/P4)^(1/3). Since P2 is 2 and P4 is 3.5, then P2/P4 = 2/3.5 = 4/7 when scaled appropriately. Therefore,  (4/7)^(1/3)

Therefore, the answer is (4/7)(1/3) power. So as a box, they likely want it in the format \boxed{\left( \dfrac{4}{7} \right)^{1/3}}.

Alternatively, some problems might write the cube root of (4/7), but the LaTeX for cube root is \sqrt[3]{4/7}, which is equivalent.

But instructions say to put the answer in \boxed{}, and given that previous ratio questions often use fractions or exponents, and since 4 and 7 are coprime, they can't be simplified, so probably the answer is the cube root of 4 over cube root of 7, or in exponent form (4/7)^(1/3).

Therefore, I think that's the answer.

**Final Answer**
The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is \boxed{\left( \dfrac{4}{7} \right)^{\frac{1}{3}}}.
