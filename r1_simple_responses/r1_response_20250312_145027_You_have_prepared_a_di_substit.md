# Original Question

You have prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR spectrum of this compound shows absorption peaks indicating the presence of an ester group. The 1H NMR spectrum shows six signals: two signals corresponding to aromatic-H, two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups. There are no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, or C12H14O2.

# R1 reasoning

Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the chemical formula of this unknown compound based on the given information. Alright, first, the compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So that means there are two substituents on a benzene ring or maybe another aromatic ring like pyridine, but since it's a student problem, it's probably a benzene ring. 

The FTIR shows an ester group. So an ester group is O=C-O-, right? So the formula would have an oxygen-containing group. Ester groups have the structure R-O-C(=O)-R'. That means in the molecule, there must be two oxygen atoms because an ester is O-C-O. Wait, ester is COO, so maybe two oxygens? Let me confirm: an ester's formula is usually RCOOR', so the formula is like with two oxygen atoms in the ester group. So the overall formula needs at least two oxygen atoms. The options given all have two oxygen atoms: O2. So that's covered.

Now, the NMR spectrum. The 1H NMR has six signals: two for aromatic protons, two for vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two for –CH3 groups. Also, no –CH2 groups. Hmm. Let's break this down.

First, the aromatic part. If the ring is di-substituted, the aromatic protons would split into two sets depending on the substituents' positions. If the substituents are para, the aromatic protons would be equivalent, but that might result in more signals. Wait. Wait, in para substituents, let's say 1,4-disubstituted, the remaining protons would be in two different environments: one set ortho to one substituent, and the other para. Wait, no. If the substituents are para, then the two hydrogens adjacent to substituent A would be equivalent, and the two adjacent to substituent B would be another set, but depending on the substituents they might split further. Alternatively, for example, if one substituent is in position 1 and another in 2 (ortho), the ring protons would have different environments, but perhaps there's symmetry. Hmm, this part might be tricky.

But according to the NMR, there are two signals for aromatic protons. That suggests that there are two distinct sets of aromatic protons. Wait, 1,2 and 1,3 substitution (ortho and meta) would lead to more splitting. Let me think. A para-substituted benzene with two substituents could have the protons being split into two groups if the substituents are different. So if you have two different substituents in the para positions, then the meta protons would be equivalent? Hmm, no, maybe not. Wait, perhaps if you have two different substituents in adjacent positions (like in ortho), then the ring protons would have different environments. Wait, but this isn't clear perhaps. I think if the ring has two substituents leading to two types of aromatic protons, that would indicate that the substituents are either meta or para, but maybe different groups.

Alternatively, they might not be benzene. Wait, but the question states a 6-membered aromatic ring. So it's not necessary to be benzene. Maybe something else like a dihydro-pyran or something else? But I think the likely scenario is benzene with two substituents.

Next are the vinyl protons. The vinyl-H have two signals, one is a doublet and one a doublet of quartets. A doublet of quartets suggests that the proton is split by two different coupling constants. Maybe adjacent to two different neighboring protons. In a typical vinyl group like CH2=CH-, the coupling would be between the two vinyl protons. But if part of a conjugated system, such as in an acrylate ester?

An ester group is present, the IR tells us that. So the substituents on the aromatic ring might include an ester. For example, one substituent is an ester group (e.g., OCOCH2CH3) and another group? But there's a vinyl group. Wait, but vinyl hydrogens... Maybe the ester is part of a vinyl group. Wait, an example could be phenyl acrylate? Acrylate ester would have double bonds, hence vinyl protons. Alternatively, maybe one of the substituents on the benzene ring is a propenyl group (-CH2CH2CH2-?) no, but that's saturated. Wait, maybe a vinyl group adjacent to the ester.

Alternatively, if the compound has a substituent of COOR (ester) and another substituent that is a substitutent bearing a vinyl group, perhaps.

But let's consider possible structures. If the benzene ring has two substituents: one is an ester group (like -OOCR), and another is a vinyl group (like CH2=CH-), but how would that play with the NMR?

Alternatively, think of some ring substituents that result in conjugated vinyl groups, such as a vinyl ether. Wait, but not sure. Let me think. If the compound is methyl benzoate derivative with a vinyl substituent.

Alternatively, if it's an ester where the oxygen is part of a vinyl group. For example, if there's a substituent like O-CO-CH2-CH2, but that's not vinyl. Wait, perhaps there's a carbonyl in conjugation with a double bond. Wait, maybe one of the substituents is an acrylate group: O-CO-CH2-CH2? No, that's again ethyl ester. Wait, acrylate is O-CO-CH2-CH2, no, an acrylate ester is O-CO
