# Original Question

The universe is filled with the Cosmic Microwave Background. Consider the annihilation of high energy \gamma-rays with a photon from the CMB Radiation into electron-positron, i.e. $\gamma\gamma\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$. From what energy \gamma-rays would have their lifetimes in the universe limited by this process? Knowing that the average photon energy of the CMB is $10^{-3}eV$.

To determine the energy of gamma-rays that would have their lifetimes limited by the annihilation process with CMB photons (γγ → e⁺e⁻), we need to consider the threshold energy required for pair production. The rest mass energy of an electron-positron pair is 1.022 MeV. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Threshold Condition**: The product of the energies of the two photons (γ-rays and CMB photon) must equal the square of the rest mass energy of the electron-positron pair.
   \[
   E_\gamma \cdot \epsilon = (m_e c^2)^2
   \]
   where \(E_\gamma\) is the energy of the high-energy gamma-ray, \(\epsilon\) is the energy of the CMB photon (given as \(10^{-3} \text{ eV}\)), and \(m_e c^2 = 0.511 \text{ MeV}\).

2. **Conversion of Units**: Convert the rest mass energy of the electron from MeV to eV:
   \[
   m_e c^2 = 0.511 \text{ MeV} = 0.511 \times 10^6 \text{ eV}
   \]

3. **Calculation**:
   \[
   E_\gamma = \frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{\epsilon} = \frac{(0.511 \times 10^6 \text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \text{ eV}}
   \]
   \[
   E_\gamma = \frac{(0.511)^2 \times 10^{12} \text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \text{ eV}} = 0.261 \times 10^{15} \text{ eV} = 2.61 \times 10^{14} \text{ eV}
   \]

4. **Rounding**: Considering the given average energy of the CMB photon (\(10^{-3} \text{ eV}\)) as one significant figure, the result is rounded to the nearest order of magnitude.

Thus, the energy of gamma-rays that would have their lifetimes in the universe limited by this process is approximately:

\[
\boxed{3 \times 10^{14} \text{ eV}}
\]

# R1 reasoning

Okay, so I need to figure out the energy of gamma-rays that would be limited by the process of annihilating with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs. The average energy of a CMB photon is given as 10^-3 eV. Hmm, let's start recall the basic concepts here. 

First, the process is gamma + gamma → e+ e-. For this to happen, the combined energy of the two photons must be at least equal to the rest mass energy of the electron-positron pair. But wait, electrons and positrons each have a rest mass of 0.511 MeV, so together that's 1.022 MeV. So the total energy of the two photons needs to be at least 1.022 MeV. But the photons are coming from different sources: one is the high-energy gamma-ray, and the other is the low-energy CMB photon. Let's denote the energy of the high-energy gamma-ray as Eγ and the CMB photon as ε = 1e-3 eV (given). 

But wait, photons are massless, so their energy is related to their frequency or wavelength. When considering collisions, it's not just about the energies but also the angle between their momenta. Because photons move at the speed of light, their collision in different frames might matter. But perhaps we can simplify this using the concept of threshold energy. The threshold condition for pair production (gamma + gamma → e+ e-) in a head-on collision is when the product of their energies in the center-of-momentum frame meets the rest mass requirement.

Alternatively, the threshold condition can be found using the invariant quantity from special relativity. The invariant squared energy in the center-of-mass frame must equal the square of the total rest mass energy. So if we have two photons with energies E1 and E2 and angle θ between their momenta, then the invariant s is given by:

s = 2 * E1 * E2 * (1 - cosθ)

But in the center-of-mass frame, s must be equal to (2*m_e*c^2)^2, which is (1.022 MeV)^2. So setting them equal:

2 * E1 * E2 * (1 - cosθ) = (2 m_e c^2)^2

Simplifying, E1 * E2 = (2 m_e^2 c^4) / (1 - cosθ)

Assuming a head-on collision (θ = π radians), so cosθ = -1, then 1 - cosθ = 2:

E1 * E2 = (2 m_e^2 c^4) / 2 = m_e^2 c^4

Hence, E1 * E2 = (m_e c^2)^2

But in that case, since one photon is from the CMB (that's E2 = ε = 1e-3 eV) and the other is the high energy gamma, Eγ. So,

Eγ * ε = (m_e c^2)^2 => Eγ = (m_e c^2)^2 / ε

So plug in the numbers:

m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV = 0.511 * 1e6 eV

Hence:

Eγ = (0.511e6 eV)^2 / 1e-3 eV = (0.511)^2 * 1e12 eV^2 / 1e-3 eV = (0.261121) * 1e15 eV = 2.61e14 eV = 261 TeV

Wait, that's 2.61 x10^14 eV? Let me check:

0.511 MeV = 0.511 * 1e6 eV = 511,000 eV

(511,000 eV)^2 = 511,000 * 511,000 = (5.11e5)^2 = 26.11e10 eV²

Wait, I think my units in the equation fell off.

But no, the equation Eγ = (m_e c^2)^2 / ε

But ε is given in eV, so when I plug:

(m_e c^2) is 0.511 MeV = 0.511e6 eV

Thus, (0.511e6 eV)^2 / (1e-3 eV) = (0.511)^2 * 1e12 (eV^2/eV) = 0.261 * 1e12 eV = 2.61e11 eV = 261 GeV

Wait, that seems like a miscalculation here. Let's do it step by step:

(m_e c^2) = 0.511 MeV = 0.511 * 10^6 eV

Then, (m_e c^2)^2 = (0.511*1e6)^2 (eV)^2 = 0.511^2 * 1e12 eV^2 = 0.261121 * 1e12 eV^2 = 2.61121e11 eV^2

Then divide by ε = 1e-3 eV:

Eγ = (2.61121e11 eV²) / (1e-3 eV) = 2.61121e14 eV

Which is 2.61e14 eV, which is 261 TeV (since 1 TeV = 1e12 eV, 261e12 eV = 261 TeV)

Wait, no. Wait. 1e12 eV is 1 TeV, so 261e12 eV is 261 TeV. However, 2.61e14 eV is 261 TeV? Hmm, 1e12 is 1 TeV, 1e13 is 10 TeV, 1e14 is 100 TeV. Wait, yes, 1e14 eV is 100 TeV, so 2.61e14 is 261 TeV.

But wait, I have an inconsistency here. Let's check carefully:

Is the threshold condition Eγ * ε = (m_e c^2)^2 ?

Wait, actually, when you have photon-photon collisions, the cross-section for pair production becomes significant when the energy of the two photons in the center-of-mass frame is above the threshold. The threshold condition is s >= (2m_e c^2)^2, where s is the square of the total energy in the center of mass frame.

To compute s for two photons:

For photon 1: Energy E1, momentum p1 = E1 / c

For photon 2: Energy E2, momentum p2 = E2 / c

Assuming they are moving in opposite directions (head-on collision), so angle between them θ = π.

The total energy squared (with c=1 in natural units) is:

s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 - p2)^2 = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2 since momentum directions.

Expanding:

(E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2 = [E1^2 + 2E1E2 + E2^2] - [E1^2 - 2E1E2 + E2^2] = 4E1E2

Thus, in natural units, s = 4 E1 E2. Setting that equal to (2 m_e c^2)^2, gives 4 E1 E2 = (2 m_e c^2)^2, so E1 E2 = (m_e c^2)^2

Thus, even when restoring units, assuming head-on collision, s=4 E1 E2

So, 4 E1 E2 = (2 m_e c^2)^2

Hence, 4 E1 E2 = 4 (m_e c^2)^2

Divide both sides by 4:

E1 E2 = (m_e c^2)^2

Therefore, threshold condition

E_high = (m_e c^2)^2 / E_low

Given that E_low is the CMB photon energy, ε = 1e-3 eV.

So plugging in:

E_high = (0.511 MeV)^2 / (1e-3 eV)

First, convert MeV to eV:

0.511 MeV = 0.511e6 eV

Therefore,

E_high = (0.511e6 eV * 0.511e6 eV) / (1e-3 eV) = (0.511^2) * (1e12 eV²) / 1e-3 eV = approx 0.261 * 1e15 eV = 2.61e14 eV = 261 TeV

Therefore, gamma-rays with energies above approximately 261 TeV would start to interact with the CMB photons and produce electron-positron pairs, hence their mean free path would be limited by this process, effectively limiting their lifetime in the universe.

Wait, but some people say that the threshold is around 100 TeV?

Hmm, but according to calculation here, 0.511 MeV squared divided by 1e-3 eV gives about 2.6e14 eV. However, confusion is easy here because of the exponents.

Wait, let me double check:

(0.511e6 eV)^2 is (0.511)^2 * (1e6)^2 = 0.261 *1e12 = 2.61e11 eV^2

Then divide by (1e-3 eV):

2.61e11 / 1e-3 = 2.61e14 eV, which is 261 TeV. So that's correct. So if a gamma ray has an energy of 261 TeV, multiplying by the CMB photon energy (1e-3 eV) gives (2.61e14 eV) * (1e-3 eV) = 2.61e11 eV². Then, we require E_low * E_high = (m_e c^2)^2 = (0.511e6 eV)^2 ≈ 2.61e11 (eV)^2, which is exactly the same. Hence at that energy, the pair production is possible.

But then, if the gamma-rays have higher energies than 261 TeV, their mean free path would be so short due to interactions with CMB photons. On the other hand, if lower than that, interactions are not possible. So this defines the threshold. However, in reality, since the CMB has a blackbody spectrum there can be photons with energies above the average (1e-3 eV). But since the average photon energy is 1e-3 eV, but the peak is around that, what does "average" here mean? The average energy per photon in the CMB is a bit higher? Wait, average energy for a blackbody is approximately 2.7kT. The CMB temperature is about 2.7 K. The energy k*T is (8.617e-5 eV/K) * 2.7 K ≈ 2.3e-4 eV. But the average photon energy is more like 3.9 kT (mean of the Planck distribution), so 0.00089 eV. Hmm. Actually, the average energy might be higher.

Wait maybe the question says the average photon energy of the CMB is 1e-3 eV. Hence perhaps 1e-3 eV is given for the average. Then, following convention. So even though in actuality calculations might differ, if the problem states the average energy is 1e-3 eV, I should use that for the energy of the CMB photon.

Hence, proceeding with epsilon = 1e-3 eV, then E_gamma = (0.511e6)^2 / 1e-3 = 261 TeV.

Thus, the cross-section for pair production peaks at the threshold and beyond, so the interaction becomes significant when the energy is above that. So high-energy gamma-rays with energy higher than ~260 TeV would annihilate with CMB photons, making their mean free path in the universe very short. Therefore, we wouldn't observe gamma-rays with energies much above that from distant sources because they would be absorbed.

Therefore, the answer would be around 1e14 eV, that is, about 100 TeV to 1 PeV. But according to precise calculation here, 261 TeV, which more accurately would be approximately 2.6 x10^14 eV. But 261 TeV is 2.61 x10^14 eV.

Wait, that's correct? Because 1 TeV is 1e12 eV. 2.6e14 eV is 260 TeV. So yes.

Alternatively, in literature, sometimes it's referred as about 100 TeV. Maybe because they use a lower energy for CMB photon, or considering different angles? But since in the problem statement it says to use epsilon = 1e-3 eV, so if strictly, 261 TeV. Although, perhaps we’re to write the answer in units? Let's think.

Alternatively, using natural units where c=1. But the calculation seems straightforward.

Ok, perhaps the final answer is the gamma-rays with energies greater than approximately 261 TeV will have their lifetimes limited by this process. Otherwise, they can't propagate through the universe without annihilating with the CMB.

Double-check:

The key formula is Egamma * epsilon = (m_e c^2)^2. Then Egamma = (m_e c^2)^2 / epsilon. Plug in 0.511 MeV for m_e c^2, square it, and divide by 1e-3 eV.

Do the calculation steps again:

m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV = 511,000 eV

(511,000 eV)^2 = 511,000 * 511,000 = 261,121,000,000 eV² = 2.61121e11 eV²

epsilon = 1e-3 eV

Then,

E_gamma = (2.61121e11 eV²) / (1e-3 eV) = 2.61121e14 eV = 261.121 TeV.

Rounded to three significant figures, that's 261 TeV. But the problem says "From what energy ... would have their lifetimes in the universe limited by this process?"

So probably answer in different units: Exceeds 100 TeV? But I have to answer quantitatively. So according to this calculation, 261 TeV. But 261 TeV is 2.61e14 eV. So wait, the problem says "lifetimes in the universe limited by this process." As in, beyond some energy, their mean free path is minuscule, so they can't propagate over cosmological distances.

This is called the "gamma-ray horizon." For energies above this threshold, gamma-rays are attenuated by the photon-photon interaction. The threshold is around that energy. In fact, here is a reference for myself: The threshold is around 1 TeV for interactions with infrared photons, However CMB is lower energy, so to pair produce with CMB, which covers lower energy photons. Wait, no:

Wait, actually, the CMB's peak is around 1e-3 eV (the question says average). So, yes, the interaction with CMB would require higher energy photons. That is, photons with energy E_gamma > ~1e14 eV (which is 100 TeV) would interact.

Wait, but our calculation gives 261 TeV. Some discrepancy here. Wait, check Google. For example, according to some references, the threshold for pair production on the CMB is roughly E_gamma ~ 10^14 eV, which is 100 TeV. Hmm, but our calculation gives 2.6e14 eV, which is ~260 TeV.

Maybe there’s an error in my calculation.

Wait: Let me see, perhaps.

No, plugging in numbers—it's straightforward. Hmm. Wait key equation:

In head on collision s = 4 E1 E2. At threshold, s = (2m_e c^2)^2, hence, E1 * E2 = (m_e c^2)^2.

E1 = E_gamma, E2 = epsilon = 1e-3 eV. Hence,

E_gamma = (m_e c^2)^2 / epsilon

m_e = 0.511 MeV/c². Hence in SI units, m_e c² is energy.

Thus,

E_gamma = (0.511e6 eV)^2 / (1e-3 eV) = 0.511^2 * 1e15 eV.

0.511 squared is ~0.261, so 0.261e15 eV = 2.61e14 eV. So yes, threshold is ~260 TeV. So is the calculation accurate?

Possible considered answer, references here: For example, introducing an example in astrophysics. Gamma rays above around 100 TeV may struggle to propagate over intergalactic distances due to interaction with CMB photons (as per Cherenkov Telescope Array), but according to the actual calculation, should be higher. Wait, but perhaps approximations. For an average photon energy. The CMB is a distribution. So the cross-section uses Integrating over CMB photon spectrum. So even though E_avg is 1e-3 eV, there are photons with lower and higher energy. So lower energy photons would have higher energy gamma-rays required. Wait:

Wait sigma (cross-section) depends on the product of E_gamma and epsilon. So even if the mean photon energy is low, some of the CMB photons have higher energies. So even below the 'threshold' gamma energy, some interactions would occur, but realistically, the cross-section becomes important near the threshold. However, precise calculation would need to consider the distribution. 

But the problem states consider the average photon energy is 1e-3 eV, so probably, you use that to calculate a threshold. So I think the answer indeed would be around 260 TeV.

So then:

E_gamma = (m_e c^2)^2 / epsilon = (0.511 MeV)^2 / (1e-3 eV) = that to eV:

0.511 MeV = 511,000 eV,

E_gamma = (511,000 eV)^2 / (0.001 eV) = (511,000^2) / 0.001 (eV)

Calculate numerator: 511,000^2 = (5.11e5)^2 = 26.11e10. So 26.11e10 (eV^2) divided by 0.001 eV gives 26.11e10 / 0.001 (eV) = 26.11e13 eV = 2.611e14 eV = 261.1 TeV.

Yes, so 261 TeV. Which is the correct value. So the answer is a bit over 250 TeV. But perhaps, in conclusion, the gamma-rays with energy above approximately 260 TeV would have their lifetimes limited by this process. Hence, the answer is 2.6 x 10^14 eV, or 261 TeV, so roughly 3 x10^14 eV. But since two significant figures: given average photon energy is 1e-3 eV with one significant figure, but m_e c² is the electron mass, known more precisely. But in typical contexts, 0.511 MeV is known well. Since the given CMB average energy is 1e-3 eV, which could be considered as one significant figure. But is 1e-3 eV exact? Hmm, but the problem states that. So perhaps 260 TeV isn't precise. Hmm. The given data has one significant figure? The average photon energy is "10^-3 eV" written as 1e-3 or 10^{-3}: if written as "10^{-3} eV", then perhaps the precision is three significant figures? 1.00e-3? Not sure.

But let's recheck number. The average photon energy for CMB at 2.7 K is kT = 0.00023 eV (since T = 2.7 K).

But the average photon energy for the CMB's blackbody is ~ 2.7kT. The average energy of a photon in a blackbody spectrum is given by ⟨E⟩ = 3ζ(4)/ζ(3)) kT ≈ 2.701 kT. For T = 2.725 K, kT = 0.235 meV ≈ 0.000235 eV. So ⟨E⟩ ≈ 2.701 * 0.000235 eV ≈ 0.000634 eV ≈ 6.34e-4 eV. But the given average is stated as 1e-3 eV, which is about 1 meV, which is higher than the standard calculation. Maybe they approximated. So if problem states to use average as 1e-3 eV, proceed with that.

Thus according to the given data, the answer is around 261 TeV. So I should present the answer as 3 ×10¹⁴ eV (i.e., 300 TeV) if one sig fig, but probably, follow through:

Given that  (E_gamma) * (epsilon) = (0.511 MeV)^2. But  0.511 MeV × … Hmm, I think in the problem statement, even if the data is approximate, the answer carries through.

Alternatively, how precise is the calculation? Given m_e c² = 0.511 MeV.

Multiply 0.511 * 0.511 = 0.261.

Multiply 1e-3 eV * gamma_energy = 0.261 *1e12 (MeV^2 to eV^2). Wait no:

Wait units more clearly:

(m_e c^2)^2 = (0.511 MeV)^2 = (0.511)^2 (MeV)^2.

But to compute (m_e c^2)^2 / epsilon. Let's convert everything to eV:

0.511 MeV = 511,000 eV.

Thus (511,000 eV)^2 is (5.11e5 eV)^2 = 2.611e11 eV².

Divided by epsilon = 1e-3 eV, gives:

5.11e5^2 / 1e-3=(511000)^2 / 0.001= 261,121,000,000 / 0.001 = 261,121,000,000,000. So 2.61121e14 eV, which is 261.121 TeV.

So accepting the problem's parametrization with average CMB photon 1e-3 eV, answer is approximately 261 TeV, which is 2.6e14 eV.

Perhaps the problem expects inches of an answer.

I think that 2.6e14 eV, which is 260 TeV. So correct answer is around there. So written as \boxed{3 \times 10^{14} \text{ eV}} the closest order of magnitude, though exact is 2.6, but most problems round to one signicant figure if the input is one. But given that m_e is known more precisely, but the given average energy of the CMB photon is 1e-3 eV (which is one significant figure). Then perhaps the answer can be 3e14 eV.

But since in precise calculation it's 261, maybe better box the exact figure?

But to check some references if possible:

In Wikipedia, the interaction of high-energy gamma-rays with CMB photons sets the gamma-ray horizon. Source that 100 TeV photons are absorbed by CMB? No, seems literature sources say: The Universe becomes opaque to gamma rays above 100 TeV due to pair production on the CMB and EBL.

Wait, according to https://arxiv.org/abs/0810.3018 The pair production on the CMB becomes dominant for photons above 10 TeV? Hmm:

"the interaction of γ-rays from distant sources with

the EBL and the CMB gives rise to energy–dependent absorption

through the production of electron–positron pairs (e.g., Gould &

Schréder 1966; Fazio & Stecker 1971; Dwek & Krennrich 2005).

Typically, this process is strong enough to suppress the observed

flux of γ-rays in the energy range from approximately

20 GeV up to 300 GeV (e.g., Hartmann et al. 2001; Mazin &

Raue 2007; Meyer et al. 2012), and above 10 TeV."

Wait—the exemption above comes from comparing with CMB + Extragalactic background light.

Depending on the background considered. So perhaps the part said "from what energy would their lifetimes in the universe be limited by this process."

If we use 1e-3 eV, then threshold is around 200 TeV. However, given that in literature this effect is considered important for 10 TeV and above, but probably considering other photon backgrounds.

But in this particular problem, the question specifically states the process with the CMB which has 1e-3 eV. So if only considering the CMB, our calculation gives ~260 TeV. However, in reality the EBL (Extragalactic Background Light) is composed of optical and infrared photons, which have higher energies than CMB (IR to optical is like ~0.1 eV to few eV), so higher energy than CMB so the threshold energy Egamma = (0.511e6)^2/eV gives lower energy thresholds (thus pair production occurs at lower gamma-ray energies). Hence with the EBL the pair production dominates at lower energies (like below TeV), but the problem specifically asks about CMB.

Thus in answer stick to solely considering CMB photons. Then yes, the threshold is 261TeV, so either a box approach.but according to the digit the problem gives for the CMB avg energy, and head-on collision.


**Final Answer**
\boxed{3 \times 10^{14} \text{ eV}}

Though the precise answer is approximately 2.6 × 10¹⁴ eV, rounding to one significant figure based on the given data gives 3 × 10¹⁴ eV.
