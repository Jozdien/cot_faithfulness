# Original Question

Compounds that have the same molecular formula but are different in their structural arrangement are known as isomers. Isomers have two types, constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but differ in their structures. In stereoisomers, molecules are connected in the same way, but their arrangements in space are different.
Among the given compounds (benzoquinone & cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione) the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) and among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate which one will show optical isomerism (B).

# R1 response

To determine which compound does not show tautomerism (A) and which compound shows optical isomerism (B), we analyze the given compounds:

**Part A: Tautomerism**

1. **Benzoquinone**: 
   - Benzoquinone (specifically 1,4-benzoquinone) has two ketone groups on a benzene ring. 
   - Tautomerism (specifically keto-enol tautomerism) requires the presence of alpha hydrogens (hydrogens on carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group). 
   - In benzoquinone, the alpha carbons are part of the aromatic ring, which stabilizes the keto form through resonance. 
   - The enol form would disrupt the aromaticity, making tautomerism highly unfavorable.
   - Therefore, benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.

2. **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**:
   - This compound is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups alternating with CH₂ groups.
   - Each ketone group is adjacent to CH₂ groups, which have alpha hydrogens.
   - These alpha hydrogens allow for keto-enol tautomerism without disrupting aromaticity (since the compound is not aromatic).
   - Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo tautomerism.

**Conclusion for Part A**: Benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.

**Part B: Optical Isomerism**

1. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:
   - The structure is CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃.
   - The second carbon (CH) is bonded to four different groups: CH₃, OH, COOCH₃, and H.
   - This creates a chiral center, leading to optical isomerism (enantiomers).

2. **Dimethyl Fumarate**:
   - The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃ in the trans (E) configuration.
   - The double bond carbons each have three substituents (COOCH₃, H, and the other CH group), so they are not chiral.
   - The molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.
   - Therefore, it does not show optical isomerism.

**Conclusion for Part B**: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism.

**Final Answer**
The compound that does not show tautomerism is \boxed{benzoquinone} (A) and the compound that will show optical isomerism is \boxed{methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate} (B).

# R1 reasoning

Alright, let me tackle this question step by step. So, first, the problem is about identifying two things: which compound doesn't show tautomerism (part A) and which compound shows optical isomerism (part B). The compounds given for part A are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. For part B, it's methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate. 

Okay, starting with part A. Tautomerism usually refers to the ability of a compound to exist in two structural isomers that are in equilibrium, typically involving the migration of a hydrogen atom and a double bond. The common types are keto-enol tautomerism, which involves a ketone or aldehyde and an enol form. So, I need to check if the given compounds can undergo such a transformation.

Benzoquinone. Hmm. Benzoquinone has two ketone groups on a benzene ring. Let me visualize its structure. Benzoquinone can be either 1,2-benzoquinone or 1,4-benzoquinone. The most common one is 1,4-benzoquinone where the two ketones are para to each other. Now, for keto-enol tautomerism, the compound must have a keto group (like a carbonyl) adjacent to a hydrogen that can move to form an enol. In benzoquinone, each carbonyl group is attached directly to the benzene ring. The adjacent carbons are part of the aromatic ring. Wait, aromatic compounds are generally stabilized by resonance. If benzoquinone were to undergo tautomerism, we'd need a hydrogen adjacent to the carbonyl to shift. But in benzoquinone, the carbonyl groups are on the benzene ring; the alpha carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl) are part of the ring. However, in a benzene ring, each carbon is bonded to one hydrogen. But wait, in the case of benzoquinone, aren't the carbons with the ketone groups (O) part of the ring? So, for example, 1,4-benzoquinone would have the ring structure with two oxygen double bonds at positions 1 and 4. But wait, the structure is actually two carbonyl groups attached to the benzene ring, so actually, two carbons of the ring are double-bonded to oxygen. Thus, the alpha positions (adjacent to the carbonyls) would be the carbons next to those. Let me sketch this mentally. For 1,4-benzoquinone, the carbonyls are on carbons 1 and 4. Then, each of those carbons are double-bonded to oxygen. The adjacent carbons would be 2,6 and 3,5? But in that case, the neighboring carbons (like 2 and 6 to carbonyl at 1) would each have a hydrogen, maybe. If there's a hydrogen on those adjacent carbons, maybe a keto-enol tautomerism is possible? Alternatively, perhaps not, because the ring may not allow the necessary structures. Wait, in keto-enol tautomerism, typically you need a hydrogen on the alpha carbon next to the carbonyl. For benzoquinone, in the para positions, if the carbonyl is on carbons 1 and 4, then the adjacent carbons (2, 6, 3, 5) — each adjacent to a carbonyl group — would each have a single bond. But since it's a conjugated system, maybe there's resonance. However, for keto-enol tautomerism, you need the alpha hydrogen. So for a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl to have a hydrogen. Alternatively, perhaps in the case of cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, it's a six-membered ring with three ketone groups alternating. Let's think about that: cyclohexane with ketones at positions 1,3,5. So it's a cyclic structure where every other carbon is a carbonyl. Now, in this case, each carbonyl group is adjacent to two other carbons which may carry hydrogens. For example, carbon 1 is a carbonyl, carbon 2 is connected to carbon 1 (which is a carbonyl) and carbon 3 (also a carbonyl). Wait, actually, in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the carbonyl groups are at 1,3,5 positions. So, carbonyls are at positions 1,3,5. Then carbons 2,4,6 are between them. So each of these in-between carbons (2,4,6) would have two hydrogens. Therefore, potentially, each ketone is adjacent to carbons (at positions 2 and 6, for example, for the 1-ketone) which do have hydrogens. Then, perhaps there's a possibility for enol tautomerism here. Let me recap. In order for a compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, a necessary component is the presence of an alpha-hydrogen — that is, a hydrogen on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl. If Benzoquinone (like 1,4-benzoquinone) has alpha hydrogens, then it can tautomerize. However, if the carbonyls are not adjacent to any hydrogens, then it cannot. 

Wait, for benzoquinone: each carbonyl group is on the benzene ring. The structure of 1,4-benzoquinone, for example: the ring has three double bonds. The two carbonyls would make the ring have two ketone groups, each at positions 1 and 4. Therefore, that means that the remaining carbons (positions 2,3,5,6) would each be part of the conjugated double bonds. So the position between two carbonyls would have carbons which are involved in double bonds. Let me get precise. If benzoquinone is:

O=C6H4-C(=O)-? Wait, more accurately, the structure is a benzene ring with two ketone groups, one at position 1 and the other at position 4. That means: if the ring is numbered such that position 1 and position 4 are diagonally opposed (para positions), but then the other positions (adjacent to 1 and 4) would be 2, 6 (adjacent to 1) and 3,5 (adjacent to 4). But being a cyclic conjugated system, the other double bonds would be fixed. Wait, but benzene rings are usually with alternating double bonds. Adding two ketone groups, maybe. Wait, but perhaps the ring in benzoquinone isn't fully conjugated but has two carbonyl groups. Wait, perhaps benzoquinone is a cyclohexadienedione?

Maybe I need to reconsider. The actual structure. Let me just visualize benzoquinone: it's a benzene ring with two oxygen atoms as ketones. So 1,4-benzoquinone would have two carbonyl groups in para positions, replacing two CH groups of the benzene. So the adjacent carbons (2 and 3 adjacent to the carbonyl at 1 and 4) are part of the ring, but each only has one hydrogen (if the ring is fully double-bonded). Wait, but if it's a quinone, the adjacent carbons can participate in double bonds. But the exact hydrogen count is important. Wait, if a carbon in the ring is connected to two double bonds, perhaps each has one hydrogen? For example, in 1,4-benzoquinone, the carbonyl is at position 1. The adjacent carbon (position 2) is double-bonded to position 3, so for carbon 2, it has a double bond to 3 and a single bond to 1 (which is a carbonyl). So if carbon 2 is part of a double bond (C2-C3 double bond), then carbon 2 would have one hydrogen. So carbon 2: attached to three bonds (one double bond to 3, a single bond to 1, and a single bond to... perhaps a hydrogen and another substituent?)

Wait, maybe I need to get the actual structure correct. Benzoquinone actually is a diketone derivative of benzene. The basic structure is two carbonyl groups on a benzene ring. For 1,4-benzoquinone (commonly called para-quinone), the carbonyl groups are in para positions. Each carbonyl is attached to the benzene ring such that the adjacent carbons are still part of the conjugated system.

But if that's the case, then the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl (let's say carbon 2 adjacent to the carbonyl at carbon 1) is part of a double bond. So, carbon 1 is C=O, carbon 2 is connected via a single bond to carbon 1 and part of a double bond (C2=C3). So in this case, carbon 2 has one bond to C1 (C=O), double bond to C3, and a single bond to another group. But in benzene rings with ketone groups, the other double bonds would rearrange. So, the exact position of double bonds is different than in benzene.

Hold on; perhaps the structure of benzoquinone is such that there are alternating double bonds between the carbons. But the presence of carbonyl groups would fix the conjugation?

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think that in benzoquinone, the hydrogens on the adjacent carbons are absent, which would prevent enol tautomerism. Because there's no alpha hydrogen? Wait, if I'm considering that the carbonyl carbons in benzoquinone are part of the aromatic ring, and the adjacent ring carbons are double-bonded, then those adjacent carbons would not have hydrogen atoms? Wait, that can't be. Let's take a step back.

In benzene (C6H6), each carbon has one hydrogen. When you have benzoquinone (1,4-benzoquinone), two of the CH groups are replaced by C=O. So there are four CH groups left. So the adjacent carbons to the carbonyl groups (positions 2,3,5,6) would each still have one hydrogen if the double bond arrangement in the ring is similar to benzene.

But wait, how exactly is benzoquinone structured? Let me check what I know. Benzoquinone is formed by the oxidation of hydroquinone. The structure has two ketone groups, oxygens double-bonded to two carbons in the ring, which are para to each other. If the carbonyl groups are in positions 1 and 4, then the positions 2 and 3, 5 and 6 are involved in double bonds. Therefore, structure like O=C-C-C-C(=O)-C-C, forming a six-membered ring. The positions of the double bonds would be between 2-3 and 5-6, leaving the carbonyl groups at 1 and 4. If that’s the case, then the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (positions 2 and 6, and 3 and 5) would each be involved in a double bond and each have a single hydrogen atom.

In order to have keto-enol tautomerism, the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl must have a hydrogen attached. Here, in benzoquinone, adjacent carbons might have hydrogens, so it is possible to have enol tautomerism. Wait, but in such conjugation, if the adjacent carbon is part of a double bond, that hydrogen may not be available. Let me visualize.

Wait, in benzoquinone, perhaps the carbonyl groups result in elimination of a hydrogen. For example, each carbonyl (at position 1 and 4) is connected to a chemically equivalent set of atoms, such that the carbons next to the carbonyls (positions 2 and 6 for 1-C=O) have single bonds. Wait, perhaps the structure isn't simple. Let me attempt to actually write the structure of 1,4-benzoquinone:

Positions 1: C=O
Position 2: CH (with one H)
Position 3: C
Position 4: C=O
Position 5: C
Position 6: CH (with one H)

But if the double bonds are between positions 2-3 and 5-6. Wait, so 1 and 4 are C=O. Then, for the quinone structure adjacent to ketones, you have single bonds? Hmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way. The key is to check whether the molecules have alpha hydrogens. If they do, then keto-enol tautomerism is possible; if not, not.

In benzoquinone, for each ketone group, is there an adjacent (alpha) hydrogen? When you have a carbonyl group (C=O), the alpha carbons are the ones adjacent to the carbonyl. For keto-enol tautomerism, those alpha carbons need to have hydrogens. So in benzoquinone, are the carbonyl groups adjacent to a carbon that has hydrogens?

If the ketones are part of an aromatic ring, like in benzoquinones, then the carbons adjacent to the ketone are still part of the aromatic ring nodes. Let me take para-benzoquinone specifically. Para-benzoquinone would have two ketone groups on the para positions of the benzene ring. Each ketone (C=O) is attached to a ring carbon, and the adjacent ring carbons are part of conjugated double bonds.

In such a case, the ring alternates single and double bonds, but the ketones impose their own pattern. However, each carbon adjacent to a ketone (let's say positions 2 and 6) that are next to the ketone at 1. Are these carbons double-bonded to another carbon? If they are double-bonded, they will have one less hydrogen. For example, a carbon with a double bond has one hydrogen, just like in benzene.

If the adjacent carbon is part of a double bond, it might have only one hydrogen. However, even with just one hydrogen, that could potentially be an alpha hydrogen. So the presence of any alpha hydrogen could allow enol tautomerism.

But on the other hand, resonance stabilization of the aromatic ring might make the enol form less favorable. Also, enol formation typically requires alpha hydrogens. Now, in case alpha hydrogens are present, but the structure is such that enol formation breaks aromaticity, thus making it highly unfavorable. So even if there are alpha hydrogens present, tautomerism might not be observed if it disrupts the aromaticity.

Conversely, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is not aromatic. It's a cyclohexane ring with three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. Each ketone group would have two alpha carbons (the adjacent carbons in the ring) each potentially with two hydrogens. For cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each carbonyl is flanked by two methyl groups, perhaps. Wait, no. The cyclohexane trione is a cyclohexane ring with three ketone groups. So every other carbon is carbonyl. Let's say positions 1, 3, 5 are carbonyl carbons (as -O-C=O). The remaining positions (2,4,6) are CH2 groups. For example:

Position 1: C=O

Position 2: CH2

Position 3: C=O

Position 4: CH2

Position 5: C=O

Position 6: CH2

Thus, forming a cyclohexane ring where every other carbon is a carbonyl. In such a structure, the carbons in positions 2,4,6 are each connected to two hydrogens and adjacent to two ketones. Therefore, each of these (2,4,6) would have hydrogens adjacent to carbonyl groups (alpha hydrogens). So each of those positions has two hydrogens, which can participate in enol tautomerism. For example, the hydrogen on the 2nd carbon (adjacent to ketone at 1 and 3) can be considered as alpha hydrogens. This would allow for keto-enol tautomerism where a hydrogen shifts from a CH2 group next to a ketone to the oxygen, forming an enol. So cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can exhibit keto-enol tautomerism.

Now, for benzoquinone: suppose if the adjacent carbons have onepossible to lose hydrogen, but due to aromaticity. Even if there were a hydrogen, the formation of an enol form would break the aromaticity of the ring, making it unstable. Hence, benzoquinone might not show tautomerism because the enol form would not be favored due to the loss of aromatic stabilization.

Therefore, between benzoquinone (assuming para) and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, it's benzoquinone that does not display tautomerism (A). Because even if it has alpha hydrogens, moving them to form an enol would disrupt the conjugated ring system and lose aromaticity, making the tautomerism highly unfavorable, so it doesn't occur. Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is non-aromatic, so de-localization is not a big factor, and the presence of alpha hydrogens allows enol tautomer (with possible conjugation? Or more stabilization via hydrogen bonds or resonance in that molecule).

So part A's answer is benzoquinone (A). Now moving to part B: which of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate shows optical isomerism (enantiomerism).

Optical isomerism occurs when a molecule has a chiral center (or other types of chirality like axial chirality). A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Let's analyze each compound.

First, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's write the structure. Propanoate refers to the ester of propanoic acid. 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester where the hydroxyl is on the second carbon. So the structure is:

The parent acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which is CH3-CHOH-COOH. Its methyl ester would be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which would be CH3-CH(OCH3)-COOCH3? Wait, no. Wait, the esterification replaces the -OH of the carboxylic acid with an -O-R group. So, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3. The ester would replace the carboxylic acid -OH with -OCH3. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3OOC-CH(OH)-CH3. Wait: Let me get that again. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. If the 2-hydroxy derivative, it's CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Esterification would make the COOH as COOCH3. So, the structure becomes CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, no, if the original is alpha-hydroxy propanoic acid, which is CH3-CHOH-COOH. Oh, no—Wait, typically, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon, which would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. But 2-hydroxypropanoic acid could be considered as:

Position 1: COOH

Position 2: CH(OH)

Position 3: CH3

Wait, numbering the carbons. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, so the carbons are:

Carbon 1: COOH, Carbon 2: CH2, Carbon 3: CH3. Therefore, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the hydroxyl group on Carbon 2, making it CH2(OH)CH2COOH.

Therefore, the ester would be methyl ester, replacing the COOH with COOCH3: CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

But wait, another way to name. Depending on the structure. Alternatively, in 2-hydroxypropanoate, the hydroxyl is on the second carbon of the propanoate. So, the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3 (if propanoate is CH2CH2COOCH3; then on the middle (2nd) carbon is the hydroxyl). So propanoic acid is in the form of HCOOCH2CH2CH3? Wait, no. Let's clarify.

The compound is "methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate". The parent acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The ester is methyl, so the structure is [CH3-O-CO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3], or perhaps [CH3-O-CO-CH(CH2OH)-CH3]?

Wait another approach: The ester is formed from 2-hydroxypropanoic acid and methanol. The acid is HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3. Wait, but to have the hydroxyl on the 2nd carbon, maybe it's HOOC-CHOH-CH3. Esterifying the carboxylic acid with methanol would substitute the -OH group in the COOH with OCH3. So the ester is CH3-O-CO-CHOH-CH3. Therefore, the structure is: 

Methyl group (from methanol) attached to the carbonyl oxygen (O of COO), then the COO is connected to a carbon chain. In this case, propanoate would have three carbons: the COO is connected to CH2-CHOH-CH3. Therefore, totaling:

O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3? Or maybe the carbonyl group is adjacent to the hydroxy group. Wait, maybe I need to re-draft.

3D structure:

The original acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. "Propanoic acid" is CH3CH2COOH. Then 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So the ester: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be methyl ester of that acid, substituting the COOH with COOCH3. Hence, it is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

In this structure, the central chain is OCH2CH2COOCH3. But wait, perhaps this structure is:

The propanoate part is -OOC-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3? Wait, wait. Maybe a better way is to imagine that the propanoate has three carbons. The central structure is:

COOCH3 is the ester group. So let's see. The full systematic name would be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The propanoate suggests a three-carbon chain as the acid part. The hydroxyl is on carbon 2. Therefore, the structure is:

Carbon 1: COOCH3

Carbon 2: CH(OH)-...

Carbon 3: CH3

But in the propanoate, carbon 1 is adjacent to the ester oxygen:

Wait, perhaps better to imagine the acid as HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3, where the carboxylic acid group is on carbon 1, hydroxyl group on carbon 2. Then, the methyl ester would replace the -OH of the carboxylic acid with -OCH3, giving: CH3-OOC-CH(OH)-CH3. So the structure is:

O

||

O-C-O-CH3  

 attached to CH(OH)-CH3.

Now, let's look for chiral centers in this structure. The carbons here are:

1. The ester group's carbon (carbonyl carbon), which is double-bonded to oxygen and connected to OCH3 and the rest of the chain. But that's not a chiral center.

2. The next carbon (connected to the carbonyl carbon) is CH(OH)CH3. So, Carbon 2: connected to the carbonyl oxygen (from COO), a hydroxyl (-OH), a methyl group (from CH3), and a carbon (connecting to the other CH3). Wait, actually, Carbon 2 would be attached to four groups: COOCH3, OH, CH3, and another carbon (Carbon 3, which might be another CH3? Does the propyl chain end here?

Wait, confusion here. Let me figure again.

If the acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid: Structure is HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3.

But wait, propanoic acid is:

Carboxylic acid - CH2-CH2-COOH. So, 2-hydroxy would be the -OH on the second carbon from the COOH. Thus:

For propanoic acid: COOH-CH2-CH2-... but then how does 2-hydroxy fit in?

Actually, carbon numbering starts from the COOH group. So in propanoic acid: carbon 1 (COOH), carbon 2 (CH2), carbon 3 (CH3). So in 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, the -OH would be on carbon 2 (the middle carbon). Hence structure is HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3. Then, forming the methyl ester would convert the carboxylic acid group (COOH) into COOCH3. So, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be:

O

||

O-C-OCH3

 connected to CH(OH)CH3.

So the full structure is methyl O-[CH(OH)CH3] carbonate or something else? Wait, Carboxylic ester is RCOO-R'. Here, R is the propanoate chain, with the hydroxyl: so R is CH2-CH(OH)-CH3, and R' is methyl. Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So the chain is -CH2CH2COOH. Its 2-hydroxy variant is -CH(OH)CH2COOH. So ester would be -CH(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, that's four atoms. Wait, maybe I messed up the positioning.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. If 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is lactic acid, actually. Wait, lactic acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid: CH3-CHOH-COOH. So when you make the methyl ester, it becomes CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. In that structure, the central carbon (the second carbon) is attached to:

- A CH3 group

- A hydroxyl (-OH) group

- A COOCH3 group

- And a hydrogen? Wait:

Structure of lactic acid (2-hydroxypropanoic acid):

CH3-C(OH)(COOH)-H. Then methyl ester is replacing the COOH with COOCH3.

So:

CH3-C(OH)(COOCH3)-H.

Therefore, the central carbon (marked with C) is connected to:

- CH3

- OH

- COOCH3

- H

So is that four different groups? Yes. Because: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. That carbon would have four different substituents: methyl group, hydroxyl group, ester group (O-CO-OCH3?), wait. No, the COOCH3 is a carbonyl-OCH3. So the COOCH3 is:

O

||

C-OCH3.

So, the central carbon is connected to:

Carboxylic ester group (COOCH3), hydroxyl (OH), methyl (CH3), and hydrogen (H). So yes, four different groups. Therefore, it is a chiral center.

But wait, the COOCH3 and the CH3 and the OH and H — those are four different groups. So the carbon is asymmetric — a chiral center, which would make the molecule optically active.

Thus methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center, so it can show optical isomerism.

Alternatively, what about dimethyl fumarate? Fumarate is the trans isomer of butenedioate. It's the ester of fumaric acid. Dimethyl fumarate would be (E)-1,2-dihydrocarboxylic acid dimethyl ester. Its structure is trans-diesters of but-2-enedioic acid. But-2-enedioic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond between carbons 2 and 3. Wait, no — fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, with the double bond between the two middle carbons, and trans configuration. So dimethyl fumarate would be the di-methyl ester: CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, where the double bond is between the two central carbons (between CH and CH), and the two ester groups are trans to each other.

In this molecule, are there any chiral centers? Let's see: the two central carbons are each attached to a COOCH3 group, either end, and double-bonded to each other. Since it's trans (fumarate is trans), each carbon in the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 and a hydrogen. For carbon 2 and 3, each has:

Carbon 2: COOCH3, CH (double bond), and two H? No, in a double bond, each carbon is bonded to three entities. Wait, the structure:

CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3.

For the double bond, the two carbons involved are each bonded to:

- Carbon 1 (attached to OOCCH3): =CH-

Then Carbon 2: double bond to Carbon 1, a COOCH3 group on one side, and a hydrogen on the other.

Wait, no. Let me re-examine. But in the actual structure, the dicarboxylic acid ester would be (trans):

O

||
O-C-OCH3  

 attached to CH2-CH2, but wait, again, specific to fumarate.

Actually, fumarate is butenedioate, specifically (E)-but-2-enedioate. Structure: HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH isn't fumaric acid; the correct structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, with the double bond between carbons 2 and 3.

Therefore, dimethyl fumarate is dimethyl (E)-but-2-enedioate, which is:

CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, where the substituents on the double bond (CH groups) are opposite each other (trans).

In such a structure, each carbon involved in the double bond (C2 and C3) has:

Carbon 2: attached to COOCH3, one double bond, and two hydrogens (Assuming). Wait, no. In trans configuration, the groups on either side of the double bond are opposite to each other.

If it's but-2-enedioate, the double bond is between C2 and C3.

Carbons 2 and 3 each have:

- Carbon 2: a carboxylate group (COOCH3), a double bond to C3, and a hydrogen.

But TRans configuration: if in the trans form, then, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

But for the chirality, we need a chiral center. In this molecule, where are the chiral centers? The carbons in the ester groups (the CH3OOC- parts) are connected to the double bond. The double-bonded carbons have each one COOCH3 and a hydrogen from the double bond. But since they're part of a double bond, those carbons can't rotate. Saying they have CH=CH with ester groups O on either end. However, each of those carbons (C2 and C3) is bonded to:

C2: COOCH3, COO-CH2? wait, no. Let's clarify. Butenedioic acid is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH — but wait, correction: NO. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. Wait, that's per IUPAC. But-2-enedioic acid: positions 2 and 3 are double-bonded. OH groups on 1 and 4.

So when converting to dimethyl ester, fingers at 1 and 4 oxygens become OCH3. So the ester has COOCH3 at positions 1 and 4.

The molecule becomes:

CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3 (double bond between C2 and C3). The double-bonded carbons (each C2 and C3) in between are each bonded to COOCH3 (on one end) and a hydrogen (on the other... wait, COOCH3 is two carbons away?

No. The structure of dimethyl fumarate is as follows:

Left side: CH3OOC– groups attached to a CH group, which is double-bonded to another CH group, which is attached to another OOCCH3.

Full structure: O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(=O)OCH3

So, the CH=CH center in the middle. Each of those carbon atoms (in the CH groups) is bonded to:

One group: =CH-COOCH3 (for the left CH), and the other is =CH-OOCCH3 (not really). Wait more precise:

Left CH: bonded to OOCCH3 (C=O-OCH3 group) via a single bond, and double bonded to the next CH.

Similarly, right CH: single bond to OOCCH3 (because the esters are at positions 1 and 4). So each CH in the double bond is connected to two groups: an ester (OOCCH3) and a hydrogen.

But no, correct:

Drawing structure line-wise:

CH3O–CO–CH=CH–CO-O–CH3

The CHs in the double bond (positions 2 and 3 in the butenodioate chain) are each connected to:

- For position 2 (left CH): a COOCH3 group (on the left), a double bond (to position 3), and maybe a hydrogen. Similarly, the position 3 has COOCH3 group to the right, a double bond to position 2, and a hydrogen? No, in reality, each of these CH groups in the double bond would only have one hydrogen or ?

Wait, no. For a conjugated di-ester, dimethyl fumarate is as follows:

Each ester group (OCH3) is attached to a carbonyl (C=O), which is attached to the CH=CH group. Therefore, the double bond is between the two CH groups, which in turn are each attached via single bond to carbonyl groups (C=O). So each carbon in the double bond is attached to:

- one C=O-OCH3 group,

- one hydrogen,

- and is part of the double bond.

Wait, but that would imply each CH is connected to three groups. Wait, each carbon must have four bonds.

So in double bond, each CH is bonded once to the other CH (double bond counts as two bonds), once to the Oxy-Carbonyl-Oxy-CH3. However:

Structure sketching:

[left] O==C-OCH3
          |
          CH
            \\
            CH
          |
O==C-OCH3 [right]

But that's not correct. Each carbon is participating in four bonds. Waiting, let's be precise:

The structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)-OCH3. But for fumarate, there is double bond. So, the actual structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(=O)-OCH3. 

Now, each of the two carbons in the double bond (CH=CH):

Each CH is attached to:

- One ester group via a single bond (O=C(OCH3)-).

- One double bond to the other CH.

Thus, each of the CH groups in the double bond is attached to:

Carbons:

Left CH:

- Bonded to O=C(OCH3) group (single bond),

- Bonded to other CH (double bond (two bonds)), 

- One hydrogen.

Hence, each CH in the double bond has three bonds.


Wait, but that adds up to four bonds? Wait, carbon must have four bonds.

Ah, no, each CH is:

- Two bonds from the double bond (one with the other carbon via a double bond),

Additionally, one single bond to O=C(OCH3), and one single bond to a hydrogen. Thus, each CH has four bonds:

CH=CH–COOCH3:

For *each* CH:

- Double bond (two bonds) to another carbon.

- Single bond to O=C(OCH3).

- Single bond to hydrogen.

Wait:

But isn't a carbon in a double bond bonded via two bonds, contributing two of their four available bonds.

Since the left CH is involved in a double bond to the other CH, one single bond to O=C(OCH3), and a hydrogen. This accounts for all bonding (two from double bond, one to O=C(OCH3), and one to H). So each CH is bonded thus:

 Each CH has two bonds in the double bond (so sharing two pairs of electrons with neighboring C), O=C(OCH3), and H. Thus, four groups: H, O=C(OCH3), and two from the double bond. Wait, but this is a misunderstanding.

Actually, for each double bond carbon (C2 and C3), each binds to three groups:

Each CH in the double bond is connected to two carbons (double bond is one bond to each) ?

No, double bond is central. For a molecule with structure O=C-OCH3-CH2-CH2-C-O-OCH3 isn't the case. Fumarate is O=C-OCH3-CH/=CH/\-C=O-OCH3. So the actual connectivity for each double-bonded carbon (say, the left one):

Left C:

- Single bond to O=C-OCH3,

- Double bond to the right C,

- And a hydrogen.

Right C:

- Single bond to C=O-OCH3,

- Double bond to left C,

- And a hydrogen.

So for each double bonded C, three substituents:

Chlorine okay, but in this structure, each carbon is connected to three groups (C=O-OCH3, H, and the other C). Each Carbon has three components but the double bond counts as two bonds. So probably arranged as:

O=C-OCH3–CH=–CH–C=O-OCH3

But in reality, but-2-enedioate is:

Positions 1 and 4 are the two carboxylate groups (as esters here), with double bond between C2 and C3. Therefore, the space the central ethylenic carbons (C2 and C3) are each connected to:

C2: connected to two groups: C=O-OCH3 (position 1) and a H,

C3: connected to C=O-OCH3 (position 4) and a H.

But I may have this rotated. Because in trans (E) configuration, the ester groups are on opposite sides. But regardless, there's still the question of this carbon having any chiral centers. However, in such a case, each of the ethylenic carbons (C2 and C3) has two substituents (C=O-OCH3) and two H’s. Oh, wait: Hmmm.

Each ethylenic carbon, part of the double bond, in fumarate, must have two substituents. Since in a double bond, each carbon can only have two double-bond-related bonds. So for C2 and C3 in dimethyl fumarate:

If the structure is (E)-O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(=O)OCH3, then each of the double bond carbons (CH=CH) have substituents: one COOCH3 group per carbon? But the trans arrangement.. naively, the two COOCH3 are on opposite sides. 

But in such a case, each ethylenic (CH) carbon would be bonded to:

Once to the COOCH3 group (one on each side),

Once to the hydrogen,

And part of a double bond.

So for each CH in the double bond:

- One COOCH3,

- One hydrogen,

- two bonds to the other CH.

Hence, each of those carbons have three substituents (HOCH, COOCH3, and two shared bonds to the other C). Since each carbon has only three substituent groups (one H, one COOCH3, and one double bond partner), doing trigonal planar geometry. No chiral center here because chiral centers require four distinct substituents. Since each CH only has three, they don't qualify for being chiral centers.

Therefore, in dimethyl fumarate, are there any other chiral centers? Take a look at the carbonyl oxygens: for each ester, the ester group is OCH3. The carbonyl carbons themselves are double bonded to oxygen, adjacent to OCH3 — but those carbons (O=C-O-) are also not chiral centers. 

So, in total, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral (stereogenic) centers, correct? Thus, if a molecule doesn't have any chiral centers and lacks other types of chirality (like planes or centers), it cannot exhibit optical isomerism. However, dimethyl fumarate does have a double bond in trans configuration. But E-Z isomerism is a type of stereoisomerism but not optical isomerism. You get diastereomers (cis and trans) but not enantiomers (mirror images that are non-superimposable)), unless there is something else. So, is dimethyl fumarate itself a trans (E) compound. But the question is whether it can show optical isomerism.

Wait, what about if the molecule as a whole is chiral? For example, if the entire molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, causing it to be chiral?

But in dimethyl fumarate, due to the symmetry. The two ester groups are on opposite ends symmetrically. If the molecule is symmetric along the center, swapping the two ester groups shouldnt change anything. For example, mirrored. Therefore, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. 

So dimethyl fumarate would be achiral and hence won't have optical isomers.

On the other hand, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, as we earlier thought, has a chiral center (the second carbon), but wait we have a confusion remfold.

Basically, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (which might be known as methyl lactate) should have a chiral center. Lactic acid (2-hydroxypropanoic acid) is Chiral, with two enantiomers. When you esterify it, replacing the carboxylic acid with an ester group, does the chiral center remain?

Yes, Because the alpha carbon (the 2-hydroxy unit) still has four different substituents. So the ester, like the acid, maintains the chiral center. Hence, there will be two enantiomers (R and S), making methyl lactate (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) capable of optical activity.

So for part B, the compound showing optical isomerism is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, thus (B) would be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Therefore, overall answers are:

A) benzoquinone does not show tautomerism,

B) methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism-

**Final Answer**

The compound that does not show tautomerism is \boxed{benzoquinone} (A) and the compound that will show optical isomerism is \boxed{methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate} (B).
