# R1 response

To determine the correct 1H NMR data for a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound (8 carbons total) with a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond, we analyze the structure and substituents. The compound is identified as a benzene ring with two substituents: a carbonyl-containing group (COCH3) and a halogen (Cl), positioned para to each other. 

**Key Reasoning:**

1. **Structure Identification:**
   - Benzene ring (6 carbons) with two substituents contributing 2 more carbons (from the COCH3 group).
   - The substituents are an electron-withdrawing group (COCH3) and a halogen (Cl), which are both deactivating groups.

2. **Substituent Positions:**
   - The substituents are positioned para to each other (4-chloroacetophenone), leading to a symmetric structure. This symmetry simplifies the NMR spectrum.

3. **Aromatic Proton Environments:**
   - **H2 and H6 (ortho to COCH3):** Deshielded due to the strong electron-withdrawing effect of the carbonyl group, appearing at higher chemical shift (δ ~7.8 ppm).
   - **H3 and H5 (ortho to Cl):** Deshielded but less so compared to the carbonyl group, appearing at a slightly lower chemical shift (δ ~7.4 ppm).

4. **Coupling Patterns:**
   - Each set of equivalent protons (H2/H6 and H3/H5) are coupled to their adjacent protons, resulting in doublets with a coupling constant J=8 Hz.

5. **Methyl Group:**
   - The methyl group (CH3) in the COCH3 group appears as a singlet (δ ~2.6 ppm) due to no adjacent protons.

**NMR Data Summary:**
- **Aromatic Protons:** Two doublets integrating to 2H each (δ 7.8 ppm and δ 7.4 ppm, J=8 Hz).
- **Methyl Group:** A singlet integrating to 3H (δ 2.6 ppm).

\boxed{\text{Aromatic protons: } \delta 7.8 \text{ (2H, d, J=8 Hz)}, \delta 7.4 \text{ (2H, d, J=8 Hz); Methyl: } \delta 2.6 \text{ (3H, s)}}

# R1 reasoning

Okay, so I need to figure out the correct 1H NMR data for a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with 8 carbons total. Also, the FTIR shows a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. Let's break this down.

First, the compound is a six-membered aromatic ring, which is probably benzene. Di-substituted means there are two substituents on the ring. Since the total number of carbons is 8, and the benzene ring itself has 6 carbons, the substituents must contribute 2 more carbons. But wait, there's also a carbonyl group (C=O), which is a carbon and an oxygen. So maybe one substituent is a carbonyl-containing group, and the other is a halogen attached to the ring.

Wait, but the substituents themselves would account for the carbons. Let me think. Benzene has 6 C, then the two substituents must add 2 C. But the carbonyl is a C=O, so if one substituent is, say, a ketone (like acetyl group, which is COCH3), that would add two carbons (the carbonyl and a methyl). But wait, that's three carbons total (O is not counted as a carbon). Wait, Hmm. Wait, the substituent would be COCH3: that's two carbons (the carbonyl carbon and the methyl carbon). But COCH3 is an acetyl group, which has two carbons attached to the ring. But then the total number of carbons would be benzene (6) + COCH3 (2 carbons, since C=O is one, then CH3 is another) and then another substituent which is a halogen. Wait, but the substituents attached to the ring: if one is COCH3 (acetophenone-like group) and the other is a halogen (like Cl, Br), then the total carbons would be 6 + 2 (from COCH3) + 0 (halogen is not a carbon) = 8. That makes sense. So maybe the compound is 3-chloroacetophenone? But wait, di-substituted. So two substituents on the benzene: one is Cl, the other is COCH3. So, positions could be para, meta, or ortho.

But in the problem statement, it's stated as a di-substituted aromatic ring. The other substituents would influence the NMR. The carbonyl (in the acetophenone group) is an electron-withdrawing group, and the halogen (like Cl) is also electron-withdrawing. Depending on their positions, the coupling and chemical shifts will vary.

In acetophenone (which is a single substituent, a ketone), the protons ortho to the ketone group are deshielded and appear around δ 7.8-8.0 ppm as a multiplet, and the meta and para around δ 7.4-7.5. But with another substituent (like Cl), the shifts would change. If the substituents are para to each other, then each substituent would have their own ortho, meta, para protons. Wait, but if it's, say, 4-chloroacetophenone, which would have the Cl and the COCH3 para to each other. Then, the ring has two substituents opposite each other. The coupling patterns would then be such that the protons adjacent to each substituent (i.e., the ortho positions) would have different shifts.

Alternatively, if substituents are meta to each other, the arrangement would have different shifts.

Considering the IR data: presence of carbonyl (strong absorption around 1700 cm⁻¹) and aromatic-halogen bond (C-X, which for Cl would have absorption around 550-850 cm⁻¹ depending on substitution, but in IR, the C-Cl stretch is usually in that range. For Br it's lower frequency. However, the aromatic C-X would be in the range, but I think the exact position might not be as critical here).

So, possible structures: the benzene ring with COCH3 and X (Cl, Br, etc.) substituents. Let's maybe assume Cl unless specified otherwise. So positions of substituents.

Now, the question is about the NMR. Let's think about acetophenone first. Acetophenone has three sets of protons: the ortho (2H, next to the ketone), which are deshielded and appear as triplet of triplets around δ 7.8, the para and meta positions (also 2H and 1H), but in practice, the splitting and integration can make them appear as a multiplet. In acetophenone's NMR, the aromatic protons typically integrate to 5H? Wait, no: acetophenone has one substituent (the COCH3), so the ring has three unique protons: two ortho, two meta, and one para. Wait, no: on the benzene ring, monosubstituted benzene with a substituent (e.g., -COCH3), the adjacent ortho positions (two protons), the para (one proton, but in di-substituted rings with para substitution?), Wait, no: in a monosubstituted benzene, like toluene, the ortho and para protons are equivalent. Wait, actually, acetophenone is a monosubstituted benzene ring with a COCH3 group. In such a case, the molecule is symmetric along the axis through the substituent. So, there are two ortho protons (which are equivalent), two meta protons (equivalent), and one para proton. Wait, no. Let me correct that. For a monosubstituted benzene:

If the substituent is -X, then the ring protons are in two sets: the two ortho to X, two meta to X, and one para to X. But in reality, because of the symmetry in the molecule, in the monosubstituted benzene:

- The ortho protons (positions 2 and 6) are equivalent.

- The meta protons (positions 3 and 5) are equivalent.

- The para proton is position 4, which is a single.

But depending on the substituent's electronic effects, these protons will have different shifts.

But in an acetophenone (monosubstituted), you end up with a triplet for the para, and so on. But in practice, the NMR of acetophenone (you can check) typically shows a multiplet around δ 7.8 ppm for the ortho protons (split into a triplet) and another multiplet for the meta and para protons. However, when there's another substituent (like Cl) in the di-substituted case, then the splitting patterns get complicated.

Alternatively, if the substitution is para, then there are two substituents opposite each other. Then, adjacent to each substituent are two ortho protons, but these would be differently affected. For example, in 4-chloroacetophenone: the substituents are COCH3 and Cl at positions 4 and 1 (assuming acetophenone is at position 1, then Cl is at 4).

Then, the remaining protons would be in positions 2, 3, 5, 6. But how are they split? The coupling may cause each proton to be split by neighboring protons, but also the substituents can deshield certain protons.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to look at a nitro group, but in this case, there's a carbonyl. Hmm. Let's think: in the disubstituted benzene with two substituents that are in para positions, each substituent would activate or deactivate the ring. But since carbonyl (as in acetophenone's ketone) is a deactivating group, and Cl (if present) is also deactivating, but as a meta director. Wait, but if two substituents are present, their directing effects combine. Whether they are ortho, meta, or para positions.

But the question is not about synthesis, but about NMR. Let's think of possible structures:

Suppose the compound is 3-chloroacetophenone. That would have Cl at the meta position relative to the acetophenone group. Then, the ring protons would have certain shifts. Let me imagine how the NMR would look.

Alternatively, 2-chloroacetophenone would have substituents in the ortho position. Depending on the positions, the aromatic protons would experience different environments.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are in such a way that there's some symmetry, which would simplify the NMR.

Wait, but if the two substituents are meta to each other, for example, then each will have their own neighboring protons. But more likely, if they're para, then there may be some symmetry which might lead to equivalent protons.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is not just a benzene ring. Wait, the total carbons are 8. Benzene (6C) plus two substituents adding 2C. So one substituent is a carbonyl-containing group and another is a halogen. For example, one substituent is -COCH3 (two carbons: the C=O, which is one C, and the CH3, which is another), and the other substituent is -Cl (no carbon). Therefore, total carbons: 6 (benzene) + 2 (COCH3) = 8. So that works. So the structure would be substituted benzene with -COCH3 and -X (halogen: Cl, Br, etc.).

Therefore, possible structures could be chloroacetophenone (with Cl and COCH3 substituents). Now, their positions on the ring (ortho, meta, para) would create different NMR signals.

Let me think of each possibility.

Case 1: Para-substituted (4-chloroacetophenone): substituents are on C1 (COCH3) and C4 (Cl). The remaining aromatic protons are on C2, C3, C5, C6. Due to the symmetry (mirror plane), C2 and C6 would be equivalent; C3 and C5 would be equivalent. Each of these pairs is adjacent to one substituent. Let me analyze their environment.

- H on C2 and C6: adjacent (ortho) to COCH3.
- H on C3 and C5: ortho to Cl.

Therefore, these protons are each ortho to one substituent and meta to the other. Since COCH3 and Cl are both electron-withdrawing groups, the protons adjacent to them would be deshielded (higher ppm). So in the NMR, H on C2/C6 (ortho to COCH3, which is strong EWG) would likely be around δ 7.8-8.0 ppm. The H on C3/C5 (ortho to Cl, also EWG) might be around δ7.4-7.6 ppm. Additionally, the meta couplings would cause splitting. But in a para-disubstituted ring with two different substituents, maybe each set (H on C2/C6 and H on C3/C5) would split differently. Alternatively, could there be two doublets?

Wait, the coupling between adjacent protons (J ~8 Hz typically for ortho coupling in benzene). But if protons are equivalent, like H on C2 and H on C6 are equivalent, adjacent to each other via the COCH3. However, in a para-disubstituted benzene, like para-chloroacetophenone, H on C2 and C6 would be equivalent (due to the plane of symmetry), as would H on C3 and C5. Each of these is adjacent to substituents.

So, H on C2 and C6: each is adjacent to the COCH3. Therefore, they would couple with H on C3 and C5 (their neighboring protons). However, for symmetry:

The H on C2 is adjacent to H on C1 (but C1 has substituent), H on C3, and H on C6 (equivalent to C2). Wait, but can't have coupling between C2 and C6 since they are across the ring. Wait, no: ortho protons are adjacent. Let me clarify the numbering:

If COCH3 is on C1 and Cl on C4:

- C1: COCH3

- C4: Cl

Then, C2 is adjacent to C1 and C3.

C6 is adjacent to C1 and C5.

C3 is adjacent to C2 and C4 (Cl).

C5 is adjacent to C4 (Cl) and C6.

So, H on C2 and C6: each is ortho to COCH3 (which deactivates and deshields), so those Hs would have higher chemical shifts. These two Hs are equivalent because of symmetry.

H on C3 and C5: each is ortho to Cl (another EWG), so those Hs would also deshield and have higher shifts but perhaps different from the COCH3 ortho.

Additionally, each of these protons is adjacent (ortho) to protons of the other set. For example, H on C2 is adjacent to H on C3 (which is ortho to Cl). Thus, each set of protons would couple with the adjacent set. So the protons on C2/C6 would each couple with H3 and H5 (ortho to Cl), and the same for the others. Wait, but in a para-substituted situation, maybe the protons would be split into a doublet of doublets.

But perhaps the para substituents create a scenario where the two sets are equivalent in terms of coupling. Alternatively, maybe both substituents (COCH3 and Cl) being in para positions lead to the remaining protons being split into two doublets. Let me consider. Each C2 and C6 H is adjacent to C3 H and C6 H? Wait, confusion!

Alternatively, example: Structure of para-substituted benzene with two groups. Let's imagine. For example, in p-dichlorobenzene, all four protons are equivalent; but in this case, substituents are different (COCH3 and Cl). So in p-substituted acetophenone and Cl, we'd have two distinct sets of Hs.

Wait, H2 and H6 (ortho to COCH3, meta to Cl); H3 and H5 (ortho to Cl, meta to COCH3). Let's think about their positions.

Yeah, H2 is attached to C2: neighboring to C1 (COCH3) and C3 (attaching H3, which is adjacent to Cl on C4). Similarly, H3 is adjacent to Cl (C4). So H2 and H6 are each adjacent to COCH3 and H3/C3 and H5 (adjacent to Cl). But in para-substituted, the symmetry would mean H2 and H6 are equivalent, and H3 and H5 are equivalent.

Each of these sets (H2/H6 and H3/H5) would see their adjacent protons. For H2: adjacent to H3 (ortho) and H1 (which is the acetophenone). Wait, no: H on C1 is where the substituent is. If it's a COCH3, then that position is a C with substituents, not an H.

So the only Hs on the ring are at C2, C3, C5, C6.

In para-substituted case, the Hs at C2 and C6 are each ortho to COCH3 (C1) and meta to Cl. Their adjacent Hs are C3 and C6 (no, for H2: adjacent are C1 (no H), C3; H6: adjacent would be C5 and C1 (no H again. Wait, if substituents are on C1 (COCH3) and C4 (Cl). Then, the other positions (C2, C3, C5, C6) have Hs.

For proton at C2: adjacent protons are C1 (no H), C3. H2 is connected to C2. So H2 couples with H3 (ortho coupling) and possibly H6 (para position?), but maybe at para, coupling is negligible. Wait, in general, protons that are ortho (adjacent) have J ~8 Hz, meta have J ~2 Hz, and para negligible. Wait, actually, para-coupled protons typically don't split each other as much because their coupling constants (J) are negligible.

So for H2, the coupling would be with H3 (ortho, J=8 Hz). H2 is on C2, next to C3. H3 is on C3, next to C4 (Cl). So H2 would split into a doublet due to coupling with H3. But H3 is adjacent to Cl. Similarly, H3 would couple with H2 and H4 (but H4 has a Cl, so if Cl replaces H, then H3 isn't adjacent to H4 but to the Cl. Hence, H3's adjacent H would be H2 and maybe H4- Oh no, C4 is substitued with Cl; so H4 is absent.

Wait, perhaps the coupling pattern for H2 would be as follows: since H2 is adjacent (ortho) only to H3. Then, H2 would couple with H3, and possibly with H6 (if long-range coupling exists), but normally aromatic coupling constants between non-adjacent protons are small. Let's ignore them for simplicity.

But if H2 is ortho to H3, each H2 couple with H3, which in turn is adjacent to H-C5? Wait, in this numbering, if COCH3 is C1, Cl is C4. Then:

- C1: COCH3

- C2: H

- C3: H

- C4: Cl

- C5: H

- C6: H

So the couplings for proton at C2: adjacent to C1 (no H) and C3 (has H). So couples to H3 (ortho, J=8 Hz).

Proton at C3: adjacent to C2 and C4 (Cl) and C4 doesn't have H, so H3 couples only to H2 (J=8 Hz) and possibly meta to H5 (C5 is adjacent to C4 and C6). Wait, H3 is at C3, and H5 is at C5. So positions C3 and C5 are across C4 (Cl). So from C3 to C5: that's meta, 1,3 relationship. So coupling constant between H3 and H5? But is the coupling possible? Normally, coupling can occur between protons that are adjacent (ortho), but meta coupling (J ~2 Hz) may also exist, but in aromatic rings, it is possible.

Therefore, H3 is coupled to both H2 (ortho, J=8) and H5 (meta, J=2).

Similarly, H5 would be adjacent (ortho) to H6 (J=8) and meta to H3 (J=2).

But since substituents are arranged in para, H2 and H6 are equivalent (symmetrical) and H3 and H5 are equivalent.

So the splitting would be complex. H2 and H6 in one set, each H2 couples to H3 (J=8), and H3 couples to H5 (J=2). But since H3 is equivalent to H5, but in different parts of the ring. So exactly speaking, would each set form a doublet of doublets?

Alternatively, with two different couplings. Let me try to model this.

H2 is adjacent to H3 (J=8 Hz) and if H3 is separated by another coupling? Not sure. Alternatively, if H2 only couples with H3 (distance makes other couplings negligible), then each H2 and H6 would each be a doublet (coupled to H3 and H5 maybe?)

Alternatively, perhaps the protons H3 and H5 are also coupled to each other. But if they're in adjacent positions, but no, in the para-substituted case, H3 is at C3 and H5 is at C5, separated by C4 (Cl), making them adjacent? No, positions 3 and 5 in a benzene ring are meta, not adjacent. Adjacent to C3 is C4 (Cl) and C2. Adjacent to C5 is C4 (Cl) and C6.

Wait, the ring positions are arranged as:

C1(COCH3) – C2 – C3 – C4(Cl) – C5 – C6 – C1.

Therefore, C2 is adjacent to C1 (COCH3) and C3.

C3 is adjacent to C2 and C4 (Cl).

C4 is adjacent to C3 and C5.

C5 is adjacent to C4 (Cl) and C6.

C6 is adjacent to C5 and C1 (COCH3).

So H2 is on C2, adjacent to C1 (no H) and C3. So couples to H3 (on C3) with J=8 Hz.

H3 is on C3, adjacent to C2 and C4 (Cl, no H). So couples to H2 (J=8) but no other adjacent proton. What about H6? H6 is on C6, adjacent to C5 and C1 (no H). So couples to H5 (on C5) with J=8 Hz. So:

- H2 is coupled with H3 (J=8), so doublet.

- H3: coupled with H2 (J=8), but no others? So would H3 be a doublet.

But H5 is on C5, coupled to H6 (J=8), so H5 is a doublet.

Similarly, H6 is coupled to H5, so doublet.

Hmm, that's getting somewhere. But in that case, we would have H2 and H6 each as doublets (each coupled to their neighbor), but since H2 and H6 are equivalent (due to the para substituents), they'd integrate to 2H each (if H2 and H6 are equivalent) and H3 and H5 also equivalent (integrating to 2H as well), each as doublets. Wait, but let's integrate:

Total protons on the ring:4 (C2, C3, C5, C6, each with one H), so four H. If para-substituted, H2 and H6 are equivalent (integrate 2H) and H3 and H5 are equivalent (integrate 2H). So, two doublets each integrating to 2H.

So in the NMR spectrum, you might see:

- A doublet around δ 7.8 ppm for H2 and H6 (ortho to COCH3, more deshielded) with J=8 Hz.

- Another doublet around δ7.5 ppm for H3 and H5 (ortho to Cl) with J=8 Hz.

But wait, the actual shifts can vary. The H2 and H6 (next to COCH3, which is a stronger EWG compared to Cl) would be higher shift. Chlorine is also EWG, but maybe COCH3 is more de-shielding. So δ values might be:

H2/H6 (ortho to COCH3): ~7.8 ppm, doublet (J=8 Hz).

H3/H5 (ortho to Cl): ~7.4 ppm, doublet (J=8 Hz).

In that case, the NMR would show two doublets each integrating to 2H. Then, perhaps also the methyl group from the acetophenone. The COCH3 group's methyl would be split. But acetophenone's methyl is typically a singlet at around δ2.6 ppm. But if there’s no splitting, the methyl would be a singlet. Unless there's some vicinal coupling or other splitting, which I think is unlikely.

So in this case, would that be the NMR? Two doublets for aromatic protons and a singlet for the methyl.

Alternatively, if the substituents are in different positions, the NMR would change. For instance, meta-substituted.

Take 3-chloroactophenone. COCH3 is on C1, Cl on C3. Then, the remaining Hs would be C2, C4, C5, C6. These would experience different environments. The splitting would be more complex.

Or if it's ortho-substituted (Cl and COCH3 adjacent). Assuming that, for example, Cl on C2 and COCH3 on C1. Then the remaining Hs are C3, C4, C5, C6. But that would have even more complex splitting, perhaps leading to multiplets.

But IR has the aromatic-halogen bond, so we know it's an aryl chloride (or bromide). So there's a C-X (X=Cl, Br) attached to the ring. Let's stick with Cl for now.

But to check, which substitution pattern gives a simple NMR as in the options. The problem states that the correct NMR data is to be identified.

Wait, since the question is presented as multiple-choice, but since the options aren't given, I need to predict. But this is thought process simulation.

However, assuming the actual NMR would reflect the substituents. If the compound has substituents in para positions, we can get two doublets each integrating to two hydrogens. Plus, the methyl group as a singlet. Also, the proton adjacent to the carbonyl (if any) but in acetophenone the ketone has no adjacent protons except methyl, which is a singlet. Chlorine does not affect the methyl, because it's on the ring, so methyl would still be singlet. Also, in acetophenone's NMR, the methyl is typically a singlet around 2.6 ppm.

If there are two substituents in para, the only other peaks should be the aromatic protons. So likely two downfield doublets (each 2H). Then a singlet (3H) at ~2.6 ppm.

If substituents are para, then the aromatic protons would be two separate doublets, while meta would cause maybe more split. Let's verify:

In the case of para, the Hs would split as I said. But what if substituents are meta?

Let's say COCH3 on C1 and Cl on C3. Then the remaining Hs are C2, C4, C5, C6. Each of these will be different. Due to the substituents' positions, fewer equivalent protons. Let me number:

C1: COCH3

C2: H

C3: Cl

C4: H

C5: H

C6: H

So now, Hs at C2, C4, C5, C6. Let's look at their environments:

C2: adjacent to C1 (COCH3) and C3 (Cl). So H on C2 is between two EWGs. Highly deshielded. Possibly appears upfield or downfield. Wait, being between two deactivating groups would decrease electron density, causing higher shift. But wait, being at C2, adjacent to both COCH3 and Cl), This would make H2 deshielded and possibly as a triplet or doublet.

H4: adjacent to C3 (Cl) and C5.

H5: adjacent to C4 and C6.

H6: adjacent to C5 and C1 (COCH3).

Due to closeness to substituents, H6 is adjacent to COCH3 (C1), so ortho to it. H4 is adjacent to Cl (C3), ortho. But there is no axis of symmetry here, so each H could be unique. However, depending on actual positions, some might be equivalent. But given that substituents are meta, the symmetry is low. So all four Hs might be unique or split into two pairs.

But this would lead to more complex multiplets in NMR spectrum. For example, H2 and H6 would each be ortho to substituents but in different positions, leading to different shifts. Hence, hard to predict without specific data. Therefore, the para substitution perhaps results in simpler NMR with two doublets.

Therefore, the correct NMR data would involve two doublets and a singlet.

Wait, but I need to also consider vicinal coupling. For example, if H2 is adjacent to H3 (which is Cl, no H), then H2 would couple with whom?

Wait, in the earlier analysis for para substitution, we thought each H2 and H6 would couple with H3 and H5 (ortho to them). But in para substitution, with substituents on C1 and C4, H2 and H6 only couple with H3 and H5.

But due to the substituents in para positions, the H2 and H6 would each be adjacent to one H (either H3 or H5) but mirror images. Maybe the coupling would be different?

Wait, maybe this is getting too complicated. Another approach is look at known NMR data. For example, looking up 4-chloroacetophenone. Let's recap:

In 4-chloroacetophenone, the substituents are para. The ring has four protons: H2, H3, H5, H6. In this case, H2 and H6 (ortho to COCH3) are equivalent, and H3 and H5 (ortho to Cl) are equivalent. Each set would have coupling between adjacent protons (ortho) so each H2 would couple with H3 (J=8 Hz), and H3 would couple with H4 (but H4 is Cl), so no, in this structure, H3 is adjacent to Cl, so it's only Coupling to H2. H2 is adjacent to H3 (no other H).

Similarly, H5 would couple with H6 (J=8) and H6 is adjacent to H5, also ortho. However, since H3 and H5 are each adjacent to Cl (C3 and C5)?

No, in para substitution:

- C1: COCH3.

- C4: Cl.

Structure:

C1 (COCH3) connected to C2 and C6.

C2 connected to C1 and C3.

C3 connected to C2 and C4 (Cl).

C4 connected to C3 and C5.

C5 connected to C4 and C6.

C6 connected to C5 and C1.

So, H2 (on C2) is adjacent to C1 (COCH3) and C3 (H3).

H3 is adjacent to C2 (H2) and C4 (Cl, no H).

H5 is on C5, adjacent to C4 (Cl) and C6 (H6).

H6 is adjacent to C5 (H5) and C1 (COCH3).

Therefore, H2 and H6 are ortho to carbonyl and adjacent to Hs:

- H2 is ortho to COCH3 and adjacent (ortho) to H3.

- H6 is ortho to COCH3 and adjacent (ortho) to H5.

H3 is ortho to Cl (but Cl is at C4) and adjacent to H2.

H5 is ortho to Cl (C4) and adjacent to H6.

But due to the para substituents, H2 and H6 have similar environments (mirror images) and H3 and H5 also.

Each H2 and H6 would show a coupling with H3 and H5 respectively. But since in para positions, they should look the same. So each of these pairs would have couplings that split their signals into doublets. So H2 would be a doublet from coupling with H3 (J=8 Hz), and H6 would be a doublet from coupling with H5 (J=8 Hz). But since H3 and H5 are mirror images, their chemical shifts are the same, and likewise for H2 and H6. So in the NMR, we would see two doublets: one for H2 and H6 (which are equivalent, so integrating to 2H each, so maybe the same shift).

Wait, maybe it's a q-integration. Wait, total aromatic protons: 4 (H2, H3, H5, H6). If symmetry:

But in actuality, H2 and H6 are equivalent (due to the plane of symmetry), and H3 and H5 are equivalent. So each pair is integrated to 2H.

Each H2/6 is coupled to H3/5. Hence, each would appear as a pair of doublets. However, when there are two separate coupling partners, but equivalent, the splitting is a bit more complicated.

Actually, for H2 and H6:

Each is adjacent (coupled with J=8 Hz) to their adjacent proton. However, H2 is coupled to H3 (which is equivalent to H5), and H6 is coupled to H5 (equivalent to H3). Therefore, because H3 and H5 are interchangeable, the coupling creates a scenario where the two protons (H2 and H6) each split into a doublet. However, because they are equivalent, this would result in the two protons being a doublet (combining the two situations). Similarly, H3 and H5 would also split into a doublet. However, more accurately, each pair would be a doublet, leading to two distinct doublets integrating to 2H each.

In practice, here's what a para-substituted ring's NMR would appear like. Each pair of protons forms a doublet. Additionally, the chemical shift for the protons adjacent to carbonyl vs those adjacent to chlorine would differ, resulting in two distinct doublets.

As for the shifts: carbonyl is a stronger deshielder than Cl substituted on the ring. Therefore, H2 and H6 (ortho to COCH3) would appear at higher ppm (e.g., δ ~7.8 ppm), and H3 and H5 (ortho to Cl) at slightly lower ppm (e.g., δ ~7.4 ppm). The methyl group as a singlet around δ2.6 ppm.

Hence, in the NMR spectrum of this compound, you would observe:

- Two doublets in the aromatic region, integrating to 2H each. First doublet higher shift (around δ7.8) and second at around δ7.4. Each with J=8 Hz.

- A singlet integrating to 3H for the methyl group.

No other peaks (assuming there are no other protons). This matches what para-substituted cases might show.

If structures were other substitutions (ortho or meta),

 in meta substitution, for example, more complex splitting would occur, possibly a multiplet with more peaks.

Given that, the correct NMR for para-substituted phanyl cpd with COCH3 and Cl substituents would be the two doublets and a singlet.


**Final Answer**
The correct 1H NMR data includes two doublets in the aromatic region (each integrating to 2H) and a singlet (3H) for the methyl group. Specifically: aromatic protons as two doublets around δ7.8 ppm (J=8 Hz) and δ7.4 ppm (J=8 Hz), and a singlet around δ2.6 ppm. \boxed{\text{Aromatic protons: } \delta 7.8 \text{ (2H, d, J=8 Hz)}, \delta 7.4 \text{ (2H, d, J=8 Hz); Methyl: } \delta 2.6 \text{ (3H, s)}}
