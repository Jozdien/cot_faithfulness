# Original Question

If an equimolar mixture X of two liquids, which decolorizes bromine water, is treated with platinum when heated, then an equimolar mixture Y of two other liquids is formed as a result of disproportionation, which does not decolorize bromine water. Hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y in the presence of platinum under rather severe conditions gives only one substance, a certain hydrocarbon Z (mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%), which is a constituent of mixture Y and widely used as a solvent. Substance Z does not react further with hydrogen. There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of the compounds of mixture X.
Indicate the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X.

Okay, so let's try to figure out this chemistry problem step by step. It's a bit tricky, but I'll start by breaking down the information given and see if I can connect the dots.

First, the problem talks about an equimolar mixture X of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. That suggests that the components of X are unsaturated compounds, maybe alkenes or alkynes, since they react with bromine water (which is a test for unsaturation). When mixture X is treated with platinum when heated, it undergoes disproportionation to form another equimolar mixture Y of two liquids that don't decolorize bromine water. So Y must be saturated, as they don't react with bromine. Then, hydrogenation of both X and Y under severe conditions gives only one substance Z, which is a hydrocarbon with 14.28% hydrogen by mass. Z is a constituent of Y and is a common solvent. Also, Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, so it's fully saturated. Additionally, the problem mentions that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in mixture X's components. Hmmm.

Let's start by figuring out what hydrocarbon Z is. The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%, which is 1/7 (since 14.28% ≈ 1/7). Let's check the chemical formula for Z.

Assuming Z is an alkane (since it's a fully saturated hydrocarbon and doesn't react with hydrogen anymore). The formula for an alkane is CₙH₂ₙ₊₂. The mass fraction of hydrogen would be:

(2n+2)*1 / (12n + 2n + 2) = (2n + 2)/(14n + 2) = 1/7

Cross-multiplying: 7(2n +2) = 14n + 2

14n +14 = 14n +2 → 14 = 2. Wait, that's not possible. Hmm, mistake here. Let me check again.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated.

Let's denote:

Mass fraction H = mass of H / total mass

For hydrocarbon Z: CₙH₂ₙ₊₂. Then:

Total mass = 12n + (2n+2)*1 = 12n + 2n + 2 =14n + 2 grams per mole.

Mass of H = (2n+2) grams per mole.

So mass fraction H = (2n+2)/(14n +2) = 14.28% = 1/7.

So solving for n:

(2n+2)/(14n +2) = 1/7.

Multiply both sides by 14n +2:

2n +2 = (14n +2)/7

Multiply both sides by 7:

14n +14 =14n +2

Again, same conclusion
