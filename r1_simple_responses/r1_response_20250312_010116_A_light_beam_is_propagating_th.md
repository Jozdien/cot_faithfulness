# Original Question

A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory? Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1.

# R1 response

To determine the speed of light in moving glass relative to a laboratory observer, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Speed of Light in Medium's Rest Frame**: In the rest frame of the glass (medium), the speed of light is \( \frac{c}{n} \). Given \( c = 1 \), this speed is \( \frac{1}{n} \).

2. **Relativistic Velocity Addition**: The glass is moving at velocity \( v \) relative to the laboratory frame. Using the relativistic velocity addition formula, the speed of light in the laboratory frame \( u \) is calculated by:
   \[
   u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + \frac{u' v}{c^2}}
   \]
   Substituting \( u' = \frac{1}{n} \) and \( c = 1 \):
   \[
   u = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
   \]

3. **Simplification**: Simplifying the expression:
   \[
   u = \frac{\frac{1 + n v}{n}}{\frac{n + v}{n}} = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
   \]

4. **Verification with Edge Cases**: 
   - If \( v = 0 \), \( u = \frac{1}{n} \), which is correct.
   - If \( n = 1 \) (vacuum), \( u = \frac{1 + v}{1 + v} = 1 \), confirming light speed remains \( c \).
   - For \( v \ll 1 \), the result aligns with the Fresnel drag coefficient approximation.

Thus, the speed of light in the glass relative to the laboratory observer is \boxed{\dfrac{1 + n v}{n + v}}.

# R1 reasoning

Okay, so there's this problem here about a light beam moving through glass, right? The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam, and I need to find the speed of the light relative to an observer in the laboratory. Hmm, let's try to break this down step by step.

First, I know that when light travels through a medium like glass, its speed relative to the medium is reduced by the refractive index. So normally, if the glass is stationary, the speed of light in the glass would be c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum and n is the refractive index. But in this case, the glass is moving. The problem states that the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam, towards the observer. So the observer is in the laboratory frame, right?

Wait, if the glass is moving towards the observer, that probably means the observer is outside the glass, in a lab where the glass is moving. The light beam is propagating through the moving glass, so we need to figure out the speed of the light from the lab observer's perspective. Since both the glass and the light are moving in the same direction, I wonder if we need to use velocity addition formulas here. In special relativity, velocities don't just add linearly, right? It's the relativistic velocity addition formula.

But wait, is this a relativistic scenario? The problem doesn't specify that the velocity v is a significant fraction of the speed of light, but since it's talking about the speed of light in a medium and mentions the refractive index, which I think does have relativistic implications. So maybe we do need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Let me recall the formula. If an object has a velocity u' in a frame S' which is moving at velocity v relative to frame S, then the velocity u in frame S is given by:

u = (u' + v)/(1 + (u'v)/c²)

Yes, that's the formula. So here, the glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame (S), and the speed of light in the glass's rest frame (S') is c/n. Therefore, if we apply the velocity addition formula, u' would be c/n, right? So substituting into the formula:

u = (c/n + v)/(1 + ( (c/n)*v )/c² )

But since the problem says c = 1, we can simplify the units where c = 1. Let me rewrite that with c=1:

u = ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + ( (1/n) * v ) )

Hmm, so that seems like the answer. Wait, but let me check if I got the frames right. The rest frame of the glass is S', where the speed of light is 1/n. The lab frame S is moving at velocity -v relative to S' (since the glass is moving at +v in the lab frame). Wait, actually, I need to be careful here.

The velocity addition formula is for transforming velocities from S' to S, where S' is moving at velocity v relative to S. So in this case, if the glass is moving at v in the lab frame (S), then S' (glass rest frame) is moving at velocity v relative to S. Therefore, when transforming from S' to S, we use the velocity addition formula where we add the velocity of the light in S' to the velocity of S' relative to S, but with the relativistic correction factor.

So if in S', the light is moving at u' = c/n (since in the glass's rest frame, the speed of light is c/n). Then, to find the speed in the lab frame S, which is moving at velocity v relative to S', we need to use the formula:

u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u'v)/c² )

But since in our case c=1, this becomes:

u = ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + (v/n) )

Therefore, the speed of light in the lab frame should be (1/n + v) divided by (1 + v/n). Let me simplify that expression:

Numerator: 1/n + v

Denominator: 1 + v/n

So let me combine numerator and denominator. Factor 1/n in the numerator:

( (1 + v n)/n ) / ( (n + v)/n )

Wait, numerator is (1 + v n)/n? Wait, no, original numerator is 1/n + v. That can be written as (1 + v n)/n? If I factor out 1/n, no, that's not true. Wait: 1/n + v = v + 1/n. Let me try expressing them over a common denominator. To write numerator as (1 + v n)/n? Let's see:

1/n + v = (1 + v n)/n? Let me compute that. If you have (1/n) + v, to combine them, multiply numerator and denominator:

= (1 + v n)/n

Yes, that's correct. Because to add 1/n and v, you can write it as (1 + v * n)/n. Let's verify:

Suppose n=2, v=0.5. Then (1 + 0.5*2)/2 = (2)/2 = 1. But 1/2 + 0.5 = 1. Yes, correct. If n=1 (which would make the medium vacuum), 1/1 + v = (1 + v*1)/1 = 1 + v. But in vacuum, speed of light is c, but if the medium is moving at v, but if n=1, the speed of light in medium is 1 (since c/n). Hmm, but that seems conflicting. Wait, but n=1 corresponds to vacuum, so the speed of light in the medium's rest frame is c=1. Then if the medium is moving at speed v, then according to the formula, the speed of light in lab frame is (1 + v)/(1 + v) = 1, which makes sense. Because even if the medium is moving, in vacuum, the speed of light remains c in the lab frame. So that checks out.

Similarly, for n=2, if the glass is stationary (v=0), the speed is 1/2.

If glass is moving at v, then speed is (1/2 + v)/ (1 + v/2 )

But let's test with low velocities, say v = 0.1. Then speed would be (0.5 + 0.1)/(1 + 0.05 ) = 0.6/1.05 ≈ 0.571, which is greater than the rest speed of 0.5, which makes sense. If the glass is moving in the same direction as the light, the speed observed would be higher than 1/n.

Alternatively, if the glass is moving opposite to the light (negative v), the speed would be lower.

So the formula seems to hold.

So according to this, yes, the speed of light in the laboratory frame is (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n ). We can also write this as:

[ (1 + n v)/n ] / [ (n + v)/n ] ) = (1 + n v)/(n + v ). Wait, but no, that arithmetic seems off. Wait, wait.

Wait, let's see:

(1/n + v)/(1 + v/n ) = [ (1 + n v)/n ] / [ (n + v)/n ] = (1 + n v)/(n + v ). Oh right! So that actually simplifies to (1 + n v)/(n + v ).

But due to algebraic manipulation.

Therefore, another way to write the expression is (1 + n v)/(n + v ). Hmm, that's interesting. Let me check:

If v approaches zero, (1 + 0)/(n + 0) = 1/n, which is correct. If n=1, (1 + v)/(1 + v) = 1, which is also correct. If v approach 1, the speed would be (1 + n *1)/(n + 1) = (1 + n)/(n + 1) = 1. Therefore, even at v approaching speed of light, the speed of light in lab frame approaches 1, which is consistent with special relativity. Because even if the medium is moving at high velocity, the speed of light remains c. That makes sense.

So in conclusion, the formula is (1 + n v)/(n + v ).

But wait, but let's confirm again step by step.

The light speed in the rest frame of the glass is u' = 1/n. The glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame. Therefore, we need to apply the relativistic velocity addition formula to transform u' to the lab frame.

The relativistic addition formula as per Einstein is:

u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/c² )

With c =1, so:

u = (u' + v)/(1 + u' v )

Here, u' is 1/n, so substitution:

u = (1/n + v)/(1 + (1/n)*v ) = (1 + n v)/ (n + v )

Yes, that's correct. So finally, the answer is (1 + n v) / (n + v ).

Therefore, the speed of light in the glass relative to the laboratory observer is (1 + n v)/(n + v ).

Is there another way to arrive at this result?

Alternatively, we might consider the Lorentz transformation for velocities. Since the glass medium is moving, but it's a continuous medium. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that would complicate things. Alternatively, moving media and light propagation have been studied, maybe using the Fresnel drag coefficient. Wait, Fresnel drag—I recall that when light propagates through a moving medium, there is a dragging effect.

The Fresnel drag coefficient formula for the speed of light in a moving medium is given by:

u = c/n + v(1 - 1/n² )

But that formula is derived for slow speeds (v << c) and is an approximation. However, the full relativistic formula is given by the velocity addition as above, resulting in (c/n + v)/(1 + (v)/(n c)) *something like that. Wait, actually, according to Fresnel's formula, the speed of light in the moving medium is u = c/n + v(1 - 1/n² ).

But here, c=1, so u = 1/n + v(1 - 1/n² )

But according to relativistic addition, the speed is (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n ).

These two are different. Wait a second. So, conflict arises?

Wait, but in the case of small velocities, the relativistic formula should agree with Fresnel's formula. Let me check. Suppose v is very small compared to c=1. Then, the relativistic formula:

(1/n + v)/(1 + v/n ) ≈ (1/n + v)(1 - v/n ) ≈ 1/n + v - (1/n)(v/n ) - v^2/n.

However, higher-order terms in v^2 can be neglected. So:

Approximately 1/n + v - v/n².

Multiplying out:

1/n + v(1 - 1/n² ).

Which matches Fresnel's formula. Thus, the relativistic formula is the exact one, and Fresnel's is the first-order approximation in v.

Therefore, the exact answer should indeed be (1 + n v)/(n + v ), given c=1, or in general terms: (c/n + v)/(1 + (v)/(n c))). So since they set c=1, yes, that's simplified to ( (1/n ) + v ) / (1 + v/n ), which is equal to (1 + n v)/(n + v ).

So that must be the answer.

Therefore, after going through the derivation, considering relativistic velocity addition, low-speed approximation leading to Fresnel's formula, and verifying with edge cases (n=1, v approaching zero or c), seems like the answer is (1 + n v)/(n + v ).

I should just write that as the final answer.

**Final Answer**
The speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is \boxed{\dfrac{1 + n v}{n + v}}.
