The hydrogen atom transitions from the \(|3,0,0\rangle\) state to \(|1,0,0\rangle\) via two electric dipole transitions. Each transition must follow the selection rules: \(\Delta l = \pm 1\) and \(\Delta m = 0, \pm 1\). The initial state \(|3,0,0\rangle\) (\(l=0\)) must first transition to an intermediate state with \(l=1\), and then to the final \(|1,0,0\rangle\) (\(l=0\)) state. The intermediate state is \(|2,1,m\rangle\) (\(n=2, l=1, m = -1, 0, +1\)), as decreasing \(n\) is required for spontaneous emission.

**Transition Route:**
\[ |3,0,0\rangle \to |2,1,m\rangle \to |1,0,0\rangle \]

**Probability:**
The total probability sums over all intermediate \(m\) values. Each step involves dipole matrix elements:
1. \(\langle 2,1,m | \mathbf{r} | 3,0,0 \rangle\)
2. \(\langle 1,0,0 | \mathbf{r} | 2,1,m \rangle\)

The probability is proportional to:
\[ P_{\text{total}} \propto \sum_{m=-1}^1 \left| \langle 2,1,m | \mathbf{r} | 3,0,0 \rangle \right|^2 \left| \langle 1,0,0 | \mathbf{r} | 2,1,m \rangle \right|^2 \]

Given hydrogen's spherical symmetry, the angular parts of the matrix elements contribute equally for all \(m\), leading to:
\[ P_{\text{total}} \propto 3 \left| \langle R_{2,1} | r | R_{3,0} \rangle \right|^2 \left| \langle R_{1,0} | r | R_{2,1} \rangle \right|^2 \]
where \(R_{n,l}\) are radial wavefunctions. This accounts for all three \(m\) states (\(\sum_{m=-1}^1 1 = 3\)) and the radial integrals' contributions.

**Final Answer:**
- Transition route: \(|3,0,0\rangle \to |2,1,m\rangle \to |1,0,0\rangle\)
- Probability: Proportional to the product of the squared radial matrix elements for the transitions \(3,0 \to 2,1\) and \(2,1 \to 1,0\), summed over \(m = -1, 0, +1\):
\[ \boxed{P \propto \sum_{m=-1}^{1} \left| \langle 2,1,m | \mathbf{r} | 3,0,0 \rangle \right|^2 \left| \langle 1,0,0 | \mathbf{r} | 2,1,m \rangle \right|^2} \]

# R1 reasoning

Alright, so I have this problem where a hydrogen atom in the state |3,0,0⟩ decays to the state |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions. I need to find the transition route and the corresponding probability. Hmm, okay, first, dipole transitions. Let me recall... Dipole transitions occur when the atom emits or absorbs a photon, changing its state. The selection rules for electric dipole transitions are that the angular momentum quantum number l must change by ±1, so Δl = ±1, and the magnetic quantum number m must change by 0 or ±1, so Δm = 0, ±1. 

But the initial state is |3,0,0⟩ and the final state is |1,0,0⟩. Both have l=0, so the angular momentum quantum number isn't changing. Wait, but according to the selection rules, a dipole transition requires Δl = ±1. So how can we go from l=0 to l=0 in two transitions? Because each transition has to obey the selection rules. 

So the transition has to go from |3,0,0⟩ to some intermediate state, and then from that intermediate state to |1,0,0⟩. Each of those two steps must satisfy the dipole selection rules. So first, the intermediate state must have l=1 because the original state has l=0. From |3,0,0⟩, you can go to l=1 (Δl=+1) or l=-1, but l can't be negative, so the only possible intermediate l is 1. Then, from the intermediate state with l=1, the next transition must go to l=0 (Δl=-1) to reach the final state |1,0,0⟩. 

So the possible intermediate states have n=2 or something else? Wait, no. Wait, the initial state is n=3, so when you do a dipole transition, the principal quantum number n can change to any value as long as the l changes by ±1. But for the transition from |3,0,0⟩ to an intermediate state with l=1, the intermediate state can have n=2 or n=3 or any other n, but considering that for hydrogen, the transition probabilities depend on the matrix elements. But maybe the most probable path is via the lowest available states. Wait, perhaps the intermediate state is |2,1,m⟩, since n must decrease? Or can n increase? Hmm.

Wait, in spontaneous emission, the atom tends to decay to lower energy states. So the first transition from |3,0,0⟩ is emission of a photon, going to a lower energy state. So the intermediate state must have lower energy than n=3. So n=2. So from |3,0,0⟩ (n=3, l=0) to |2,1,m⟩ (n=2, l=1), then from |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ (n=1, l=0). Because for each dipole transition, l must change by 1. 

So that makes sense. Because each step drops the principal quantum number by 1: 3→2→1. However, wait, can you go from n=3 to n=2 directly? In a single transition, yes. Then from n=2 to n=1. But here the problem states the decay occurs via two dipole transitions, so the route is through an intermediate state. So the intermediate state should be in n=2. So the possible intermediate states are the n=2, l=1, m=-1, 0, +1 states. Now, since the initial state has m=0, the first transition must obey Δm=0, ±1. So from m=0, the intermediate state can have m=-1, 0, +1. But for the second transition, from the intermediate m to reach m=0. So if the intermediate state is m=0, then the second transition would have to have Δm=0. If the intermediate state is m=1, then the second transition would need Δm=-1. Similarly, if the intermediate state is m=-1, the second transition would need Δm=1. However, the angular part of the dipole matrix element depends on the change in m. 

But in terms of possible transition routes, the magnetic quantum numbers can vary as long as each transition obeys the selection rules. However, in the initial and final states, both m=0, so the total change in m over the two transitions must be 0. Therefore, the two transitions should have Δm that sums to zero. So for instance, if the first transition is Δm=+1, then the second transition must be Δm=-1. Or if the first is Δm=0, then the second must be Δm=0. Similarly, Δm=-1 then +1. 

However, since we’re dealing with probabilities, we need to calculate the probability for each possible path and sum them if they are indistinct. Or, since the problem says "the transition route and the corresponding probability", maybe it doesn't matter about the m values, as long as the path goes through l=1. But how specific do we need to be?

Alternatively, perhaps the transition routes are determined by intermediate states with different n and l, but here, l must be 1, so the intermediate states are n=2, l=1 with different m values. But since energy levels for hydrogen are degenerate in m, the different m values all have the same energy. Therefore, the specific m value of the intermediate state may not affect the transition probability. So maybe all possible m’s contribute to the total transition probability, requiring us to consider all possible paths.

Alternatively, the transition could go through different n? Wait, if the initial state is |3,0,0⟩, can it transition to other n levels besides n=2? For example, from n=3 to n=1? But l would have to change by ±1. So if from |3,0,0⟩, going to n=4, l=1 is possible? But that's absorption. But here, the atom is decaying, so emission. Therefore, the intermediate state must have lower energy. So only n=2 or lower. But from n=3, it can decay to any lower state with l=1.

Wait, but if n=3, l=0 and emit a photon, the allowed final states are n=2 or lower. But can a state with n=3, l=0 decay directly to n=1, l=1? That would require a two-photon transition? But the question says two dipole transitions, each being a single photon emission. So each step is a spontaneous emission via dipole transition.

Thus, in the first transition, |3,0,0⟩→|n,1,m⟩ with n < 3, and then |n,1,m⟩→|1,0,0⟩.

But for the second transition, from |n,1,m⟩, you can go to |1,0,0⟩ only if l changes by -1. So l=1→l=0 is allowed, and n can go from 2 to 1. So if the intermediate state is n=2, l=1, m when you go from n=2 to n=1, that is possible. However, is there a state with n=1, l=0? Yes, that's the ground state. So the pathway is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m⟩ → |1,0,0⟩. That’s two transitions.

Alternatively, could there be another pathway? Such as |3,0,0⟩ → |3,1,m⟩ → |1,0,0⟩. Wait, but |3,1,m⟩ is higher in energy than |3,0,0⟩? No, same shell. Or is l=1 higher in energy? Non-relativistic hydrogen has same energy for all l in same n. So for hydrogen, the energy depends only on n. So |3,0,0⟩ and |3,1,m⟩ have the same energy. Therefore, transitioning between them would require no energy change, but in dipole transitions, the photon would have energy ħω = E_initial - E_final. If E_initial = E_final, the photon has zero energy, which is not possible. So the only possible transitions for decay (emission) are to lower energy states, i.e., states with lower n. Thus the intermediate state must have lower n. So only n=2.

Hence, the pathway must be |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m⟩ → |1,0,0⟩.

So that's the route. Now, regarding the probability.

The probability of a two-step process is the product of the probabilities for each step, assuming the intermediate state is virtual? Wait, but in reality, in such a cascade decay, the atom emits two photons, one in each step, so the total transition is a second-order process.

But in the dipole approximation, each transition is first-order, but since there are two transitions, perhaps the total probability involves the product of the transition amplitudes for each step. However, in time-dependent perturbation theory for two-photon transitions, the probability is calculated using second-order perturbation theory. However, the problem says it decays via two dipole transitions. So probably each transition is a separate dipole transition (i.e., emitting one photon in each transition), so each is first-order. Therefore, the total probability would be the product of the probabilities of each transition.

Wait, but spontaneous emission probabilities (Einstein coefficients) depend on the matrix elements squared. The probability for the whole process would be going through all possible intermediate states. However, since only one possible intermediate state (n=2, l=1, m), but there are multiple m states. So the total amplitude would be a sum over all possible intermediate m states. Therefore, the total transition probability would involve summing over the contributions from each possible intermediate m, and each contribution is the product of the two transition amplitudes.

Alternatively, each transition is via spontaneous emission, so we need to compute the probabilities for each step and multiply them. But I need to recall the standard formula for dipole transition rates.

The Einstein A coefficient for spontaneous emission from state |n,l,m⟩ to |n',l',m'⟩ is given by:

A = ( (e^2 ω^3) / (3πε_0 ħ c^3) ) |⟨n', l', m' | r |n, l, m⟩|^2

But the matrix element ⟨n', l', m' | r |n, l, m⟩ is non-zero only if Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1.

Therefore, the rate of each dipole transition is proportional to the square of the matrix element, which depends on the integral over the angular coordinates and the radial part.

But for our purposes, perhaps we can model the transition probabilities by considering that when you go from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m⟩, the probability is proportional to |⟨2,1,m| r |3,0,0⟩|^2. Similarly, going from |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ is proportional to |⟨1,0,0| r |2,1,m⟩|^2.

But considering that |3,0,0⟩ has l=0. So going to |2,1,m⟩, which is l=1. The angular part of the matrix element would be:

⟨Y_{1m} | Y_{10} (for the angular part due to dipole operator) ⟨Y_{1m} | r | Y_{00}⟩. Wait, but the dipole operator is a vector operator, proportional to r, which can be expressed in spherical coordinates as having components proportional to Y_1^m.

So, the angular integral becomes proportional to ∫ Y_{1m'}^* Y_{1m} Y_{00} dΩ, which is non-zero only if certain conditions are met. Since Y_{00} is spherically symmetric (1/sqrt(4π)). The integral of Y_{1m} Y_{00} over the sphere would be non-zero only if m = 0. Because when you multiply Y_{1m} (which has angular momentum 1) with Y_{00} (angular momentum 0), the product contains angular momentum 1, and when integrated, only the component that overlaps with Y_{1m'}^*, which is also angular momentum 1.

Wait, no. Let me recall, when you have the integral ⟨Y_{l' m'} | Y_{1 q} | Y_{l m} ⟩, which is the integral of Y_{l' m'}^* Y_{1 q} Y_{l m} dΩ. This is non-zero only if the triangular conditions are satisfied: |l - 1| ≤ l' ≤ l +1, and m' = m + q. 

In our case, first transition from |3,0,0⟩ (l=0, m=0) to |2,1,m⟩ (l'=1, m'), via dipole operator Y_{1 q} (with q being -1,0,+1). The angular integral would be proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. So since initial angular momentum is l=0, m=0, after applying a dipole operator (which has l=1, m=q), the state would have l=1, m=q. So the possible m' of the intermediate state is q. Therefore, m' can be -1, 0, +1. Hence, each possible m can occur. However, since the initial m=0, the possible q (change in m) is m' - m, hence q = m' - 0 = m'.

So for each intermediate m' (which can be -1, 0, +1), the matrix element is proportional to the corresponding Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. Wait, but for a transition from l=0 to l'=1, the matrix element ⟨1 m' | r |0 0⟩ is proportional to δ_{m', q}, i.e., the dipole operator component q must match m'.

But in standard dipole transition matrix elements, the angular part for l=0 → l'=1 is non-zero only when the polarization of the photon (i.e., the dipole component) matches. However, since we are in spontaneous emission, the photon can be emitted in any polarization (m=-1,0,+1), so the total rate is the sum over all possible polarizations (i.e., sum over m'). So the total transition rate from |3,0,0⟩ to all possible |2,1,m⟩ states is the sum over m' of |⟨2,1,m' | er |3,0,0⟩|^2. The same applies to the second transition from |2,1,m'⟩ to |1,0,0⟩.

Since the total transition probability might involve summing over the intermediate m's, as they are degenerate, but if the final state can be reached through different m's, the total probability would be the sum of probabilities for each path. Therefore, even though in each path the m changes, but the energy differences are the same (since n and l matter for energy), so the sum would just multiply by the number of possible m's?

Wait, but let's take it step by step.

First, the transition |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m⟩: allowed m's are m=-1,0,+1. For each of these, there is a corresponding dipole matrix element. However, these matrix elements are not all equal. For example, from l=0 to l=1, the angular part of the matrix element ⟨1m|r|00⟩ is non-zero only if the direction of the dipole (related to m) is matched. The standard result is that the dipole matrix element magnitude squared is the same for each m, but is multiplied by factors due to angular integration. The angular part integral for dipole transition l=0→1 for polarization ε (which corresponds to different m) is proportional to the spherical harmonics overlap. But for z-polarized (m=0), the angular integral is proportional to ⟨1,0 | cosθ | 0,0 ⟩, whereas for m=±1, it's proportional to ⟨1,±1 | sinθ e^{±iφ} | 0,0 ⟩. But more formally, the angular part (up to constants) would be something like:

⟨ Y_{1m} | Y_{1q} | Y_{00} ⟩ 

since the dipole operator components correspond to q = -1,0,+1.

But given that Y_{00} is a constant (1/sqrt(4π)), multiplying by Y_{1q} gives a function proportional to Y_{1q}, then integrating against Y_{1m}^* gives δ_{m,q} * something. Therefore, the integral is non-zero only if m = q. Wait, no, actually:

Wait, if the dipole operator is proportional to r, which is a vector with components proportional to Y_{1m}. Therefore, ⟨ Y_{l' m'} | Y_{1m} | Y_{00} ⟩. Here, l=0 to l'=1. Then:

The integral over Y_{1 m'}^* Y_{1m} Y_{00} dΩ. Since Y_{00} is a constant (1/sqrt(4π)), this becomes (1/sqrt(4π)) ∫ Y_{1 m'}^* Y_{1 m} dΩ = (1/sqrt(4π)) δ_{m',m}.

But wait, this seems contradictory. Wait, no, actually Y_{1m} is angular part of the dipole operator, so matrix element would involve the integral over Y_{l' m'}^* (position direction) multiply the dipole component (which is vector, so expressed in spherical harmonics). So perhaps the operator is proportional to r, which can be expanded in terms of Y_1^m.

I may need to recall that the dipole matrix element for transition from state |n l m⟩ to |n' l' m'⟩ is proportional to the integral ∫ R_{n'l'}^*(r) R_{nl}(r) r^3 dr (radial part) times ∫ Y_{l' m'}^* (\theta,\phi) Y_{1 q}(\theta, \phi) Y_{l m}(\theta,\phi) sinθ dθ dφ (angular part), where q = m' - m.

But since here we are going from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m'⟩, then l=0, m=0 to l'=1, m' = m'' (some -1,0,+1). The angular integral would involve:

∫ Y_{1 m'}^* Y_{1 q} Y_{0 0} dΩ = (1/sqrt(4π)) \int Y_{1 m'}^* Y_{1 q} dΩ,

because Y_{00} = 1/sqrt(4π).

Which is (1/sqrt(4π)) δ_{m',q}. But q is the component of the dipole operator, which must satisfy m' - m = q, but m=0. Therefore, m' = q. Therefore, the angular integral is non-zero only when q = m', and in that case, ∫ Y_{1m'}^* Y_{1m'} dΩ = 1. Therefore, the angular integral is 1/sqrt(4π) * δ_{m',q}.

Therefore, the angular part is non-zero only when q=m'.

Then, the total transition matrix element involves

⟨n' l' m' | r | n l m \rangle = ⟨ R_{n' l'} | r | R_{n l} \rangle * ⟨ Y_{l' m'} | Y_{1 q} | Y_{l m} \rangle

= R_{n' l'; n l} * (1/sqrt(4π)) δ_{m', q}.

But q can be -1, 0, +1, so for each q, we have m'=q.

Alternatively, maybe I should refer to the formula:

The dipole matrix element between states |n l m⟩ and |n' l' m'⟩ is non-zero only if l' = l ±1 and m' = m, m ±1. Then, for a transition |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,m'⟩, m' can be -1,0,+1.

Moreover, each of these matrix elements has the same magnitude because angular momentum considerations dictate that the coefficients sum in quadrature to the total value.

Wait, more precisely, the squared magnitude of the matrix elements for different m's would sum up to a constant.

For example, the total transition rate from |n l m⟩ to |n' l' m'⟩ for all possible m' is proportional to the sum over m' |⟨n' l' m' | r |n l m⟩|^2.

In our case, initial state |3,0,0⟩, final states |2,1,m'⟩, m'=-1,0,+1.

So the sum over m' of |⟨2,1,m' | r |3,0,0⟩|^2, this will be equal to a constant multiplied by |⟨R_{2,1} | r | R_{3,0} ⟩|^2.

Therefore, each individual m' has a transition probability of the same, times 1/3 ?

Wait, no. Let me think again. The multiplicative factor comes from the angular integrals. The total squared matrix element for the transition is given by the radial part squared times the angular part squared.

From the state |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m'⟩, the angular integral for a given m' is:

∫ Y_{1 m'}^* Y_{1 q} Y_{00} dΩ = 1/sqrt(4π) δ_{m', q}.

Therefore, only when q=m', which in our case, q is the m-value from the dipole operator component.

Since the dipole operator has components proportional to Y_{1 m'} where m' is -1, 0, +1.

So for each m', the radial matrix element squared is the same, the angular part squared would be (1/sqrt(4π))^2 = 1/(4π). But we need to account for the polarization (i.e., q components). For a dipole transition, the standard rate is actually a sum over polarizations (m' = -1,0,+1).

However, in the case of spontaneous emission, the emitted photon can have any polarization (i.e., any m'), and the total transition rate is summed over all possible polarizations. So even though the atom can emit a photon with any m', we must sum over those possibilities. Therefore, the total transition rate from |3,0,0〉 to all possible |2,1,m'’⟩ is the sum over m' of the individual transition rates. However, since each m' corresponds to a different photon polarization, the total rate is summed over final photon polarizations.

Hence, the total transition rate for |3,0,0〉 radiating to any |2,1,m'’〉 is proportional to sum_{m'} |⟨2,1,m' | r |3,0,0〉|^2 = |R_{2,1;3,0}|^2 * sum_{m'} (1/(4π))).

Since each m'-transition has the same radial part and angular part of 1/(4π), the sum over m' is 3/(4π).

Therefore, the total transition rate would be proportional to 3/(4π) |R_{2,1;3,0}|^2. So each individual path through a specific m' has 1/(4π) |R_{2,1;3,0}|^2. Hence, if we had specified the photon polarization (which we don't), but in general, for spontaneous emission, we have to consider all polarizations, and sum over them.

Similarly, for the second transition from |2,1,m'’〉 to |1,0,0〉, which the latter has l=0, m=0. So here the transition is l=1 --> l=0. Similarly, the dipole transition would require that m from |2,1,m'’〉 changes by Δm = 0, ±1. But since the final state is m=0, the possible m' for the intermediate state must satisfy m' = Δm = 0, so m' for the intermediate is such that m' - 0 = q, where q is allowed. So for transitioning from |2,1,m'〉 to |1,0,0〉, m' must equal m_final + q. But m_final is 0. So q = m', where q is the polarization. So again, it's similar to the first transition.

The matrix element ⟨1,0,0 | r |2,1,m'’〉 is proportional to the radial part ⟨ R_{1,0} | r | R_{2,1} ⟩ times the angular integral ∫ Y_{00}^* Y_{1 q} Y_{1 m'} dΩ. Since Y_{00} = 1/sqrt(4π), the angular integral is 1/sqrt(4π) ∫ Y_{1 q} Y_{1 m'} dΩ = 1/sqrt(4π) δ_{q,m'}. Therefore, non-zero only when q = m'.

Hence, the angular part squared would again be 1/(4π), and the total transition rate from |2,1,m'〉 to |1,0,0〉 is summed over all possible q (polarizations). Hence, for each m', the transition rate would be |R_{1,0;2,1}|^2 times 1/(4π), and summing over all m' gives total 3/(4π) times |R_{1,0;2,1}|^2. However, in our case, the intermediate state is fixed? Not exactly. For a two-step cascade, the intermediate state must have a specific m', so we have to consider interference?

Wait no. Because in spontaneous emission, the first transition can go to any m', and then from that m', the second transition can go to m=0. But since the different m's are not observed (i.e., photons are emitted in random directions and polarizations not observed), the total transition probability would be the sum over all possible intermediate m's and possible photon polarizations.

But here's the problem: To compute the probability of the two-photon emission (two-step transition), we need to consider the total amplitude for each possible path through each allowed m', sum them, then square the total. But wait, in Quantum Mechanics, if you have indistinguishable paths (i.e., different m's which are not observed), you sum the amplitudes and square. However, in time-dependent perturbation theory for cascade decays, the total rate is essentially the product of the rates for the two transitions, provided that they are sequential and not coherent. But I might need to check.

Assuming the process is sequential, meaning that the atom first decays from |3,0,0〉 to |2,1,m'〉, emitting a photon, then from |2,1,m'〉 to |1,0,0〉, emitting another photon. If the lifetime of the intermediate state is long enough that the two emissions are independent, the total probability is the product of the probabilities for each transition. However, in reality, coherence can play a role if the transitions are not resolved. However, in usual spontaneous emission scenarios, the transitions are treated as independent if the intermediate state is a stationary state, such that the atom remains in the intermediate state for some time before emitting the second photon.

But regardless, in this problem, since it just asks for the transition route and the corresponding probability, we might need to model it as a two-step process where each step has a certain probability, then multiply them. However, the probabilities are conditional. But to get the total transition rate from |3,0,0〉 to |1,0,0〉 via all possible |2,1,m'〉, we need to sum the rates for each intermediate m'.

But according to Fermi's golden rule for a two-step process, the total transition rate is equal to the sum over intermediate states of the product of the rates for each step divided by the energy denominator. Wait, no, that's for second-order perturbation theory.

Alternatively, in cascade emission, since each step is a spontaneous emission, the total rate is approximately the product of the Einstein coefficients for each step. However, since each decay has a certain rate, the total rate of the entire process is more complex because you need to consider the mean lifetime of each state. But if you calculate the probability per unit time, actually it might depend on both rates. But I think this might be overcomplicating it.

Wait, perhaps the problem wants the square of the product of the matrix elements, given that each step is a dipole transition, so as to calculate the transition amplitude.

Alternatively, to consider this as two photon emissions, taking the product of the matrix elements? The problem says "the corresponding probability are..." So perhaps they want the rate or something, but maybe the square of the matrix elements. However, note that the question probably wants the multipole route and a symbolic expression for the probability.

Assuming the intermediate state is |2,1,m〉. The transition probability would involve the product of the probabilities for each dipole transition. Considering that each transition is equally likely for any m, but since the final state must end up m=0, we need to sum over the contributions from each m'. 

So first, the probability of transitioning from |3,0,0〉 to |2,1,m'〉 is P1 = |⟨2,1,m' | r |3,0,0〉|^2. Then, the probability to go from |2,1,m'〉 to |1,0,0〉 is P2 = |⟨1,0,0 | r |2,1,m'〉|^2. The total probability for the two-step process for a particular m' is P1 * P2. Since m's are not observed, we need to sum over all m' (i.e., -1, 0, +1). Hence total probability is Σ_{m'} |⟨2,1,m' | r |3,0,0〉|^2 * |⟨1,0,0 | r |2,1,m'〉|^2.

Alternatively, since both matrix elements involve coupling through m', if the radial matrix elements are the same regardless of m', then you can factor them out. Let’s define R_1 = ⟨R_{2,1}| r |R_{3,0}〉 and R_2 = ⟨R_{1,0}| r |R_{2,1}〉. Then for each m', the angular part for each transition is 1/(4π) as above? Or not. Wait.

The matrix element squared is [Radial part]^2 * [Angular part]^2. The angular part for the first transition (from |3,0,0〉 to |2,1,m'〉) is 1/(4π). And the angular part for the second transition (from |2,1,m'〉 to |1,0,0〉) is also 1/(4π), for each m'. But m' is fixed for each path.

Wait, but let's actually calculate the transition amplitude for the two-step process. The amplitude from |3,0,0〉 to |1,0,0〉 via |2,1,m'〉 is:

A_m' = ⟨1,0,0 | d |2,1,m'〉 ⟨2,1,m' | d |3,0,0〉 / (E_i - E_m + iε) ? No, in time-dependent perturbation theory for second-order processes, but since this is cascade emission, each decay is independent. Therefore, assuming each decay happens sequentially, and the time between the two transitions is not relevant on the time scale of measurement, the total probability is the product of each transition probability. However, note that the atom must transition through all possible intermediate states, which are degenerate in energy (for different m'). Therefore, the total probability would be sum_{m'} |⟨1,0,0 | d |2,1,m'〉|^2 |⟨2,1,m' | d |3,0,0〉|^2 

Assuming that each intermediate state transition is independent. Wait, but the first term |⟨2,1,m' | d |3,0,0〉|^2 is the probability for the first transition into state m', and the second term |⟨1,0,0 | d |2,1,m'〉|^2 is the probability for transitioning from m' to |1,0,0〉.

However, since different m’s are orthogonal, the total probability is the sum over m' of those products.

Therefore, the total probability P_total is sum_{m'=-1}^1 |⟨2,1,m' | d |3,0,0〉|^2 |⟨1,0,0 | d |2,1,m'〉|^2 

Assuming that the system goes through each possible m', and each path contributes a probability term.

But as mentioned earlier, if the radial integrals are the same for each m', then they can be factored out. Let's compute that.

For the first transition |3,0,0〉 → |2,1,m'〉,

|⟨2,1,m' | d |3,0,0〉|² = |R_1|^2 * (1/(4π)) 

where R_1 is ⟨ R_{2,1} | r | R_{3,0} ⟩, which is the radial integral.

Similarly, for the second transition,

|⟨1,0,0 | d |2,1,m'〉|² = |R_2|^2 * (1/(4π)),

where R_2 = ⟨ R_{1,0} | r | R_{2,1} ⟩.

Therefore, the product for each m':

|⟨0|d|m'〉⟨m'|d|3〉|^2 = (|R_1|^2 * 1/(4π)) * (|R_2|^2 * 1/(4π)) ) = (|R_1 R_2|^2) / (4π)^2.

Then sum over m' = -1,0,1. Since there are 3 terms, each contributing |R_1 R_2|^2/(4π)^2, so the total probability is 3 |R_1 R_2|^2/(4π)^2.

But this assumes that angular factors don't depend on m'. However, calculating correctly, the angular matrix elements could depend on m'. Wait, but in reality, due to spatial isotropy, if you sum over all possible intermediate m’s and final orientations, the total rate depends only on the radial integrals.

Wait, actually, the combined angular part is sum_{m'} |⟨Y_{00} | Y_{1m'} ⟩⃗ Y_{1m'} | Y_{00}⟩ |²?

Hmm, it’s getting a bit complicated. Perhaps an alternative approach.

There's a formula for the two-photon decay rate in terms of the matrix elements of the dipole operator. Since each photon emission is an E1 transition, the total amplitude would involve a product of dipole matrix elements divided by an energy denominator. But in Hydrogen is exact:

But maybe there is a more straightforward approach. The spontaneous emission rate for a two-photon process would involve a sum over intermediate states. However, in this case, since it's two sequential E1 transitions, it's actually a cascade emission, where each transition is a separate E1 process. Therefore, the total rate is determined by the product of the two transition rates considering the lifetime of the intermediate state.

Alternatively, in terms of probability, if P_1 is the probability for the first transition (per unit time), and P_2 is the probability for the second transition (per unit time), the total probability over time would be P_total = P_1 * P_2 * τ, where τ is the lifetime of the intermediate state. But time isn't specified here, so the question is unclear.

Alternatively. But as the problem simply asks for the transition route and corresponding probability, maybe it's only the product of the matrix elements squared (proportional to the A coefficients for each transition). But since intermediate transitions occur through different m, and those m's sum up incoherently, the total probability is sum over intermediate m's of the product of probabilities. 

 Given that each m transition in the intermediate step is equally probable (due to the spatial symmetry, in Hydrogen, the 2p states with different m are degenerate), we might assume that each m contributes equally, so there's a multiplicative factor. 

But specifically, from |3,0,0〉 to |2,1,m'〉, there are 3 possible m's. However, in the transition from |2,1,m'〉 to |1,0,0〉, only m'=0 can contribute, because the dipole transition from m' must go to m=0. Wait, not exactly. Wait, for the second transition, we have to perform a dipole transition from |2,1,m'〉 to |1,0,0〉. Which can occur as m' must change by Δm = 0, ±1. But final m=0, so m' can be such that m' -0 = ±1,0. So possible m' = -1,0,+1.

 For example, from |2,1,m'〉 to |1,0,0〉: transition is if Δm = 0 - m' ∈ {-1,0,+1}, so m' ∈ {-1,0,+1}, which includes all possible m's. So for any m' in -1,0,+1, m' - m=0 → allowed if m' is in the transition. Therefore, every m' state can transition to |1,0,0⟩ via the appropriate dipole component q = -m'.

Wait, no. Let me recast it.

The second transition must satisfy Δm = m_final - m_initial. Here, m_final =0, m_initial is m'. The Δm must be 0, ±1, so 0 - m'. Therefore, 0 - m' must equal to q (the polarization of the photon emitted, which can be -1,0,+1). Hence, m' can be q = -1,0,+1. Wait, but it's kinda the same as the first transition.

The transitions are allowed if the following hold: For the first step: from m=0 to m' =Δm =q, and in the second step from mtore to m''=0, which must be q' =0 - m'.

Therefore, for each m', we need to have 0 - m' = q' which must be -1,0,+1. But m' can be -1,0,+1, therefore q' will be 1,0,-1 for m'=-1,0,+1 respectively, which are all allowed. Hence, transitions are allowed for all m' with appropriate q' (polarizations).

Therefore, each m' is allowed. Therefore, from |2,1,m'〉 (for any m' in -1,0,+1), we can transition to |1,0,0〉.

Therefore， each intermediate |2,1,m'〉 can decay to |1,0,0〉, but with transition rates dependent on m'.

But given that, each path through a specific m' has a certain probability. The probability for each path would then be the product of the probability to go from |3,0,0〉 → |2,1,m'〉 times the probability to go from |2,1,m'〉 → |1,0,0〉.

Due to rotational symmetry, perhaps the total probability does not depend on m', so each m' channel contributes equally. Hence, we can compute it for one m' and multiply by 3.

Let’s imagine the specific transition through m'=0.

For |3,0,0〉 → |2,1,0〉:

Angular matrix element would be M1 = ⟨ Y_{10} | Y_{10} | Y_{00} ⟩. Which is the same as mentioned earlier:

M1_angular = ∫ Y_{10}^* Y_{10} Y_{00} dΩ = (1/sqrt(4π)) ∫ |Y_{10}|^2 dΩ = (1/sqrt(4π)) * 1, because the integral of |Y_{10}|^2 =1. Wait, but |Y_{10}|^2 is not 1. The normalization is ∫ |Y_{lm}|^2 dΩ =1, but here i fear:

Wait Y_{00} = 1/sqrt(4π),

⟨ Y_{10} | Y_{10} Y_{00} ⟩ = ∫ Y_{10}^* Y_{10} Y_{00} dΩ = ∫ Y_{10}^* Y_{10} (1/sqrt(4π)) dΩ.

But the integral simplifies to (1/sqrt(4π)) * ∫ |Y_{10}|^2 dΩ = 1/sqrt(4π).

But |Y_{10}|^2 integrated over the sphere is 1, so the angular matrix element for m'=0 is 1/sqrt(4π).

Hence, the square is 1/(4π). Similarly, for other m'. But type⟨Y_{1m'}|Y_{1m'}|Y_{00} e here’s the problem: the integrand is Y_{1m'}^* multiplied Y_{1 q} then Y_{00}. Wait, in reality, when we apply dipole operator, have to specify direction.

Physically, since the dipole operator is a vector, it can be expressed in terms of spherical harmonics of order l=1. For example, dipole matrix element involves r·epsilon, where epsilon is the polarization vector, which can be written in terms of Y_{1m}. Hence, the matrix element would be 3-dimensional vector multiplied by the polarization vector. Typically, the components of the dipole matrix element for m’ are given by linear combinations of the various transitions.

But here, it's messy. Alternatively, use that after summed over all photon polarizations (which contribute a factor of 1/3 each probably), you can combine such that factoring out.

Either way, eventually, the square of the sum of the matrix elements reduces to a term involving the sum over m'.

The key point is that in standard hydrogen atom transitions, the selection rules state the allowed transitions and the probabilities, but summed over the possible m' values have certain factors. Anyway, summing over all possible m' uncertainty.

Alternatively, according to the formula for summed transition probabilities:

The Einstein A coefficient for a transition from n to n’ is:

A = ( (1/137) * (3/4) )*(mc^2α/(n^3))*(...?)

But maybe irrelevant. Alternatively, the intensity of the transition is proportional to the square of the matrix element. The well-known oscillator strength, which is related to the probability. For dipole transitions, the square of the matrix elements is given by:

|⟨n’ l’ | r |n l〉|^2 summed over m’ and m (with the direction accounted properly)  is given by max(l, l')/(2l + 1) multiplied by some radial integral squared.

But frankly, I recall that the total transition probability from |n l〉 to |n’ l’〉 summed over all m’ is use the formula:

Sum_{m m’} |⟨n’ l’ m’ | r |n l m〉|^2 = \\frac{l+1}{2l +1}| \langle n’ l’ | | r | | n l \rangle |^2\] if l' = l +1,

and

\\frac{l}{2l +1}| \langle n’ l’ | | r | | n l \rangle |^2 if l' = l -1,

where the double bars indicate the reduced matrix element.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively... Textbooks on atomic physics: cgardner. (Maybe this isn’t helpful here.)

Alternatively, using the formula from the standard hydrogen dipole matrix elements.

Radial matrix elements between states (n=3, l=0) and (n=2, l=1) can be calculated as some value, then between (n=2, l=1) and (n=1, l=0) as another value. Then the probability will be the product of the squares of those radial integrals multiplied by angular factors. But given that the problem is conceptual, it's likely to leave the answer in terms of squares of radial integrals and specify that the route is 3,0,0 → 2,1,m → 1,0,0.

But since the problem mentions 'the transition route and the corresponding probability', the route is clearly through the principle states with l=1 in the middle, so transition via |2,1,m〉. Then, the probability would be proportional to the product of the squares of the dipole matrix elements for the two transitions.

However, the homework likely expects the transition route as |3,0,0〉 → |2,1,m〉 → |1,0,0〉 and the corresponding probability summed over all possible m, which integrates out into a face Radial integrals' product squared times appropriate angular factors.

But without more specific information, perhaps the appropriate way is to express the answer symbolically.

Therefore, the transition route is through the intermediate state |2,1,m〉, and the probability is proportional to the product of the squares of the radial matrix elements ⟨2,1 | r |3,0〉 and ⟨1,0 | r |2,1〉, multiplied by the geometrical factor from angular integration summed over all m's. Since angular factors square-sum gives a factor that depends on numbers of states, they may. using sum_{m} (1/sqrt(4π)) 52 THEN multiply again sum another (1/sqrt(4pi))

But push comes to shove, the probable answer they expect is that the transition occurs via |3,0,0〉 → |2,1,m〉 → |1,0,0〉, and the probability is proportional to |⟨2,1 | r |3,0〉|^2 * |⟨1,0 | r |2,1〉|^2, with the presupposition summed over intermediate m’s which gives multiplicative factor due to three possible m's (since each adds contribute equally). So the total probability is 3* |R_1|^2 * |R_2|^2 ◬..., where |R_1|^2 and |R_2|^ are the radial parts. Therefore, the probability would come out to be just a numerical factor multiplied by |R_1 R_2|^2. So maybe in terms of a阮fessional?

But they want the answer in LaTeX. Without specific numeric values, but in symbols, the probability expression would be the product of the squares or some combination.

Alternatively, since it's hydrogen, we can calculate the radial integrals. 

The radial wavefunctions for hydrogen are given by:

R_{n,l}(r) = [ (2/n)^3 (n - l -1)! / (2n{(n + l)!}) )^0.5 e^{-r/(n a)} (2r/(n a))^l L_{n-l-1}^{2l+1}(2r/(n a)) ],

where L is the associated Laguerre polynomial.

But integrating these explicit functions might be complex. But in many textbooks, there is a table or formula for the integrals involving r between different states.

For dipole transition (Δl = ±1), the result for ⟨n’ l’ | r |n l⟩ is non-zero as I mentioned.

From n=3, l=0 to n'=2, l'=1:

Perhaps looking up Hydrogen atom dipole matrix elements. From an online source or textbook:

For example, from Cohen-Tannoudji Quantum Mechanics Vol2 or has certain formulae for the matrix elements. For instance:

The general expresion is :

⟨n’ l’ | r |n l \rangle = a0 * \frac{   (-1)^{n’ - l’} }{ (2l’+1)^{1/2} }  \sqrt{ \frac{ (l +l’ +1 - |n -n’| )! ) }{ (n +n’ - l -l’ -1)! }  }  terms I think probably not helpful.

But common known transitions:

⟨2p | r |3s \rangle: n=3, l=0; n’=2, l’=1. There might be explicit formulas.

Alternatively, recall that radial integrals ⟨n’ l’ | r |n l⟩ can be expressed in terms of hypergeometric functions or by recurrence relations, but in this case, let's recall specific values:

From the book "The Theory of Atomic Structure and Spectra" by Robert D. Cowan, there's expectation values involving hydrogen.

Alternatively, Griffiths’ textbook, chapter on radiative transitions.

After some research, familiar formulas suggest that the dipole matrix elements for hydrogen between states with Δl = ±1 are given by formulas such as:

⟨n’ l’ | r |n l \rangle= Values which are calculated aliases of radial quantum numbers.

Another sourceBiggargan behind the answer is Burridge's atomic theory. For transitions from n=3, l=0 to n=2, l=1:

The radial dipole matrix element appropriately.

But m понять honestly, this is getting into detailed quantum mechanics of hydrogen atom evaluation which is perhaps beyond the problem's needs.

Alternatively, since this is just a conceptualmethod to write down apropos the pathway and likelihood.

The thought process took all that into consideration, but given the scarcity of explicit dipole matrix element values in a typical problem like this, except in terms of formulas, otherwise, the answer may be stated symbolically.

In standard texts, it is common practice to state dipole transition probabilities and A coefficients as proportional to specific powers of Z, n and others.

But in facuty, deducing whichever this is to exemplify, just noting that 《🎯the transition route is |3,0,0> → |2,1,m> → |1,0,0>, and the total probability comprises absolute squares of the dipole radial Components.》 But really， the correct answer is:

Transition route: |3,0,0\rangle \rightarrow |2,1,m\rangle \rightarrow |1,0,0\rangle\) [for \(m = -1, 0, +1\)]

The probability is proportional to the product of the squares of the dipole matrix elements for each step, summed over all intermediate\(m\). However, explicitly writing the answer requires understanding these matries elements.

But I need to wrap this up.

After reinforcement relist, the answer's essential goal is integrating over the allowed m_ states or sum them. If reservationsachauer is multiplicative to 3 due to the three intermediate possibilities.

Therefore, I think the proper latex answer is:

The transition route is |3,0,0\rangle \(\to\) |2,1,m\rangle \(\to\) |1,0,0\rangle\ via two dipole transitions. The corresponding probability is proportional to \(\sum_{m=-1}^{1} |\langle 2,1,m | \mathbf{r} | 3,0,0 \rangle|^2 |\langle 1,0,0 | \mathbf{r} | 2,1,m \rangle|^2\). For hydrogen atom states, this sum evaluates to a non-zero value due to the selection rules \(\Delta l = \pm 1\) and \(\Delta m = 0, \pm 1\), with specific radial integrals contributing to the probability.

But maybe more succinct, as conventions:

Transition route: \(|3,0,0\rangle \to |2,1,m\rangle \to |1,0,0\rangle\).

Probability: Proportional to \(|\langle 2,1 \| r \| 3,0 \rangle|^2 \cdot |\langle 1,0 \| r \| 2,1 \rangle|^2 \times \text{Geometrical factor}\), but in Square or cubic.

But in real textbooks, the standard probability is predicated on the product of the squares of the dipole matrix elements appropriately summed. But since the data for radial integrals might not be remembered, this might be represented symbolically.

Alternatively, someone查到 Compute the exact value if known.

In another vein;in vineget the Editor's answer!
