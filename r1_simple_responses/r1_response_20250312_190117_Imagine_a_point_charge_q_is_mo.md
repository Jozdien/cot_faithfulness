# Original Question

Imagine a point charge q is moving with a trajectory $\vec{s}(t)$, where t is time, with respect to the origin. Let $\vec{r}$ be the field point, where the field is observed, with respect to the origin of the same reference frame, and  $\vec{d}$ be the vector from the point where the electromagnetic field was generated at some earlier time $tr$ to the observation point $\vec{r}$. The velocity of the moving charge q at the field generating instant $tr$ is $\vec{v}$. What are the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (\vec{A}) at time t, satisfying $t > tr$, and position $\vec{r}$? In obtaining the expressions, use the notation of $c->$ light speed in vacuum, $\epsilono ->$ permitivity of free space and $\mu_o$ is the permeability.

The scalar potential \( V \) and vector potential \( \vec{A} \) at position \(\vec{r}\) and time \( t \), generated by a moving point charge \( q \) with trajectory \(\vec{s}(t)\), are described by the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials depend on the retarded time \( t_r \), the position of the charge at \( t_r \), and its velocity \(\vec{v}\) at \( t_r \). The vector \(\vec{d}\) is the displacement from the charge's position at \( t_r \) to the observation point \(\vec{r}\).

The scalar potential \( V \) and vector potential \( \vec{A} \) are given by:

\[
V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{|\vec{d}| - \frac{\vec{v} \cdot \vec{d}}{c}}
\]

\[
\vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0}{4 \pi} \frac{q \vec{v}}{|\vec{d}| - \frac{\vec{v} \cdot \vec{d}}{c}}
\]

where:
- \( \epsilon_0 \) is the permittivity of free space,
- \( \mu_0 \) is the permeability of free space,
- \( c \) is the speed of light in vacuum,
- \( |\vec{d}| \) is the magnitude of the vector \(\vec{d}\),
- \(\vec{v} \cdot \vec{d}\) is the dot product of the velocity vector \(\vec{v}\) at \( t_r \) and the displacement vector \(\vec{d}\.

### Final Answer
The scalar potential \( V \) and vector potential \( \vec{A} \) at time \( t \) and position \( \vec{r} \) are given by:
\[
V(\vec{r}, t) = \boxed{ \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{|\vec{d}| - \frac{\vec{v} \cdot \vec{d}}{c}} }
\]
and
\[
\vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \boxed{ \frac{\mu_0}{4 \pi} \frac{q \vec{v}}{|\vec{d}| - \frac{\vec{v} \cdot \vec{d}}{c}} }.
\]

# R1 reasoning

Okay, so I need to find the scalar potential V and the vector potential A at a point r and time t, generated by a moving point charge q that was at position s(tr) at the retarded time tr. The charge is moving along a trajectory s(t), and the potentials are observed at position r and time t, which is later than tr. The vector from the charge's position at tr to the observation point is d, and the velocity of the charge at tr is v. Hmm. 

First, I remember that for moving charges, the potentials are given by the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. But let me try to recall the exact forms. I think they involve the retarded time, the position of the charge at that retarded time, and the velocity of the charge at that time. 

Wait, the retarded time tr is the time when the charge emitted the field that is now (at time t) reaching the observation point r. So the delay is because the electromagnetic fields travel at the speed of light. So the distance between the charge's position at tr and the observation point r is d, which implies that d = |r - s(tr)|, and the time it took for the field to travel that distance is tr = t - d/c. But maybe that's the definition of retarded time. 

The key thing is that when we calculate the potentials at (r, t), we have to consider where the charge was at the retarded time tr such that c(t - tr) = |r - s(tr)|. 

The scalar potential V and vector potential A would then depend on the charge's state at tr: its position, velocity, and possibly acceleration. However, I believe Liénard-Wiechert potentials are for a charge in arbitrary motion, considering only the velocity at the retarded time, but in some formulations, the acceleration appears as well. Wait, no—in the standard Liénard-Wiechert potentials, the potentials are expressed in terms of the charge's velocity at the retarded time, without needing the acceleration? Or is that wrong?

Wait, no—maybe both the velocity and the acceleration are involved? Wait, no. Let me think. The Liénard-Wiechert potentials are for arbitrary motion, but the potentials themselves only depend on the retarded position, velocity, and the distance, but I think the acceleration comes into play in the expressions for the electric and magnetic fields, not the potentials themselves.

So the potentials V and A are given by:

V(r, t) = (1/(4πε₀)) * [ q / ( (1 - (v ⋅ \hat{d}) / c) * |d| ) ] evaluated at the retarded time tr.

Similarly, A(r, t) = (μ₀/(4π)) * [ q v / ( (1 - (v ⋅ \hat{d}) / c) * |d| ) ] evaluated at tr.

But wait, d is the vector from s(tr) to r, right? So |d| is the distance between s(tr) and r. So maybe d is r - s(tr). 

Let me confirm.

In the standard Liénard-Wiechert potentials, the scalar potential is:

V(r, t) = (1/(4πε₀)) * [ q / (κ R) ]

where R is the distance between the charge's position at tr and the observation point, and κ is 1 - (R ⋅ v)/c, with R being the vector from the charge to the observation point. Wait, so κ is 1 - (v ⋅ R̂)/c, where R̂ is the unit vector in the direction of R. So more precisely, κ = 1 - \vec{v} ⋅ (R vector)/ (c |R| ) ) ?

But in the problem statement, they've defined d as the vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point. So d = r - s(tr). Therefore, R ≡ d. So |R| is |d|. Therefore, the scalar potential should be:

V = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / ( |d| (1 - (v ⋅ d̂)/c) )

Similarly, the vector potential A is (μ₀/(4π)) * q v / ( |d| (1 - (v ⋅ d̂)/c) )

But then, since μ₀ε₀ = 1/c², then μ₀/(4π) can be expressed in terms of ε₀, but perhaps the question wants it as is.

Wait, I think that's the expression. So to write it in terms of d, the vector from the retarded position to the observation point, velocity v at tr, then the potentials are:

V(r, t) = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / [ (d) * (1 - (v ⋅ d̂)/c) ].

But isn't there also a factor involving the magnitude of d, |d|?

Wait, in many textbooks, the denominator is R(1 - β ⋅ R̂), where R is the vector from the charge to the observation point, and β = v/c. So that would adjust the denominator to |d| - (v ⋅ d)/c. Because R̂ = d / |d|, so (1 - (v ⋅ R̂)/c) = 1 - (v ⋅ d)/(c |d|), and R is |d|. So then denominator becomes |d| (1 - (v ⋅ d̂)/c) = |d| - (v ⋅ d)/c.

So the scalar potential can be written as:

V = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / [ |d| - (v ⋅ d)/c ]

Similarly for the vector potential:

A = (μ₀/(4π)) * q v / [ |d| - (v ⋅ d)/c ]

Alternatively, sometimes written with R = |d| and the term in the denominator is R - (v ⋅ R)/c, so same thing.

In terms of the given variables, since d is the vector from the charge at tr to the observation point r, then |d| is the distance between those two points, and (v ⋅ d)/c is the dot product of the velocity (at tr) and d divided by c. That term is the Doppler factor or something similar.

Alternatively, maybe using the numerator as v scaled by 1/c? Wait, in terms of units, if we have μ₀/(4π) times q v over (|d| (1 - v ⋅ d̂ /c )), that would have the correct units: for A, weber per meter. But let's check.

Yes, SI units:

Electric scalar potential V is in volts (J/C), vector potential A is in tesla·meter or weber/meter.

So, our proposed expressions:

V = [1/(4πε₀)] * q / [ |d| (1 - (v ⋅ d̂)/c) ]

A = [μ₀/(4π)] * q v / [ |d| (1 - (v ⋅ d̂)/c) ] 

But wait, Liénard-Wiechert potentials can be written in terms of the retarded quantities, but they are also sometimes expressed with a denominator |d| - (v⋅d)/c. So perhaps we can write:

V = [1/(4πε₀)] * q / [ |d| (1 - (v⋅d̂)/c) ] = [1/(4πε₀)] * q / ( |d| - (v⋅d)/c )

Since |d| (1 - (v⋅d̂)/c) is |d| - |d|*(v⋅d̂)/c. But d̂ is d/|d|, so (v⋅d̂) = (v⋅d)/|d|. Therefore,

|d|*(v⋅d̂)/c = |d| * (v⋅d)/( |d| c ) = (v⋅d)/c. 

So the denominator is |d| - (v⋅d)/c, hence the expression simplifies to |d| - (v ⋅ d)/c.

Therefore, the scalar potential is also:

V = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / [ |d| - (v ⋅ d)/c ]

Similarly, vector potential:

A = (μ₀/(4π)) * q v / [ |d| - (v ⋅ d)/c ]

So either form is acceptable. But which notation does the problem prefer? The problem statement mentions that d⃗ is the vector from the charge's past position to the observation point, and v is the velocity at tr. 

So in both cases, if we write the denominator as |d| multiplied by (1 - (v ⋅ d̂)/c ), or as |d| - (v ⋅ d)/c, they are equivalent. But perhaps the question wants it in terms of |d| and (v ⋅ d), but given the variables provided, perhaps that's the way to do it. Alternatively, express it with d and v ⋅ d, since the user mentioned d as the vector from the charge to the observation point. 

Alternatively, note that 'd' has direction, so perhaps (v ⋅ d)/c is then okay, but without the unit vector. Wait, no. v is velocity, d is the vector from charge's position at tr to the observation point. The terms would be properly v ⋅ (d / |d| ), multiplied by |d|, which gives v ⋅ d. So to ensure we have the right notation, better to use |d| - (v ⋅ d)/c in the denominator. But is this correct? Let's check.

Wait, so given tr and the fields propagating at speed c, the retarded position s(tr), and the observation position r. The distance between them is |d| = |r - s(tr)|. But there's also the relative velocity. When the charge is moving, we have the denominator modified by the velocity term in the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. So when you compute the potentials, the denominator is not just the distance |d|, but adjusted by 1 - ( v(t_r) ⋅ (d / |d| ) ) / c. Which is 1 - (v ⋅ d̂)/c.

Multiplying by |d|, the denominator is |d| ( 1 - (v ⋅ d̂)/c ) = |d| - (v ⋅ d)/ c. So both forms are correct, and indeed related. Therefore the answer can be written either way, but in terms of the given variables, it might be better expressed. However, since in the problem they just call d the vector from the charge's past position to the observation point, they might not have specified a direction, but are we allowed to write (v · d) as part of the denominator?

Well, (v ⋅ d) would be from v (a vector at tr) dotted with d, which is the displacement vector from charge's tr position to r at observation. So the dot product is coordinate dependent, but the potential expressions already are dependent on the coordinate system, so that's okay. 

Thus, the final expressions:

Scalar potential V(r, t) = q/(4πε₀) * 1 / ( |d| - (v ⋅ d)/c )

Vector potential A(r, t) = μ₀ q v/(4π) * 1 / ( |d| - (v ⋅ d)/c )

Where d is the vector from the retarded position to the observation point, and v is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time tr.

Alternatively, maybe using the numerator (for A as μ₀ q v ) and denominator with the same term. That should be correct, given the units. Let's check units. V would have units of (C)/(F/m * m) ) which is (C)/( (C²/(N·m²)) * m ) ) => (N·m²/C) / m = N·m/C. Wait, potential V is in volts (J/C), which is N·m/C. So 1/(4πε₀) has units of N·m²/C², multiplied by C and divided by meters, so (N·m²/C² * C ) / m ) = N·m/C which is V, so that works. Similarly, A: μ₀ has units of T·m/A. So (T·m/A) * C⋅(m/s) / ( m ) → (T·m/A) * C/s → T·(C/(A·s)) ??? Wait. Maybe better to check. μ₀ is in H/m (henrys per meter), and 1 H is Wb/A. A weber is V·s or T·m². So μ₀ in H/m is (V·s/(A·m)) so (V·s·A⁻¹·m⁻¹). The numerator is q·v in C·(m/s). So qv is C·m/s. Then μ₀ q v is ( V·s/(A·m) ) * (C·m/s ) ) = (V·s·C)/(A·s) ) = V·C / A. Since V is J/C, so substituting, (J/C) * C / A ) = J/(A) = (N·m)/ (C/s · s ) )= N·m/(C) ?Hmm, perhaps mistakes here.

Alternatively, think about vector potential A which is in T·m, so Weber/m. Let’s calculate:

μ₀/(4π) * q v / ( denominator )

μ₀ has units kg·m/(C²). Since μ₀/(4π) is a constant with units kg·m/(C²).

q is in Coulombs (C), v in m/s. denominator is |d| - (v ⋅ d)/c. [Check units: |d| is in meters, (v ⋅ d)/c has units of (m/s * m)/ (m/s) ) ] → m. So denominator is in meters, so the whole fraction is (C * m/s ) / m) = C/s. Then μ₀/(4π) * (C/s) in units of kg·m/(C²) * C/s) = kg·m/(C·s). But the unit of A should be kg·m/(s²·A). Wait, but C/s is Ampères. So kg·m/(C²) * ( C·m/s ) / m ) = kg·m/(C²) * (C/s) ) = kg·m/(C·s). Hmmm, whereas vector potential is kg·m/(s³·A), perhaps?

Wait, maybe a different approach: Unit of vector potential A is Tesla·meter. Since B is Tesla, and B is related to A by B = ∇ × A. But A is Webers/meter, which is equivalent to Tesla·meter. So Webers (Wb) is Volt·seconds. So A is V·s/m. The V is J/C, J is N·m. So V·s/m is (N·m/C)·s/m = (kg·m/s²·m/C)·s/m = kg/(C·s). That seems complicated, but let's see the expression. Alternately, go for input terms:

Looking at the expression for A: μ₀ is in H/m. H (henry) is Wb/A = (V·s)/A. So μ₀ is (V·s)/(A·m). The rest, q v / denominator: denominator is in meters, since |d| and (v·d)/c has same unit (c is m/s, v·d is m/s * m, divided by c is m/s * m * s/m = m). So variables: denominator is in meters. So denominator m. Then q is C, v is m/s. So q v is C·m/s. Thus [q v / denominator ] is (C·(m/s)) / m = C/s. So the whole A becomes: (V·s/(A·m)) * (C/s) ) = (V·C)/(A·m). Since V is J/C, substitute: (J/(C)) * C)/(A·m) ) = J/(A·m) = (N·m)/(A·m) = N/A. And N is kg·m/s², so units: kg/(A·s²). Hmm, but vector potential A should have units kg/(s²·A), because Tesla is kg/(s²·A). Since Tesla·meter is (kg/(s²·A)) * m, which is kg·m/(s²·A). Wait, we're getting into a unit quagmire here. Maybe our original confusion comes from messy unit analysis. My point is that the units should check out, but perhaps I've messed up the computation. Alternatively, just accept that the standard Liénard-Wiechert expressions are correct as given by standard EM textbooks, so the expressions for A must have correct units. So regardless, perhaps I just give the answer as the standard Liénard-Wiechert potentials, adjusted with the given notation.

Therefore, the answer is:

V(r, t) = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{|\vec{d}| \left(1 - \frac{\vec{v} \cdot \vec{d}}{c | \vec{d} | }  \right) }

Wait, but the denominator is (1 - (v ⋅ d̂)/c ) multiplied by |d|. So we can also write |d| - (v ⋅ d)/c.

If we use d as the vector and not just the magnitude, that would be (1 - (v ⋅ \vec{d}) / (c |\vec{d}| )) * |\vec{d}|. However, the problem states that the field is observed at \vec{r}, and \vec{d} is from the charge's position at tr to \vec{r}. So since |\vec{d}| is d = | \vec{r} - \vec{s}(t_r) |, then maybe it's better not to write the denominator as scalar terms. But the expressions can also be written in terms of the dot product. Either way works.

Alternatively, may be cleaner to write denominator as d⋅(1 - (v ⋅ \hat{d}) / c ). But in the answer, I would need to use the given notation.

Wait, in the problem statement: Use the notation of c (light speed), ε₀ (permittivity), μ₀ (permeability). 

In the original question, the user also defines:

$\vec{d}$ as the vector from the point where the electromagnetic field was generated at some earlier time $tr$ to the observation point $\vec{r}$. That is, $\vec{d} = \vec{r} - \vec{s}(tr)$. So yes, vector from retarded position to observation.

So finally, expressing the Liénard-Wiechert potentials in terms of d and v. So the standard formulas written using:

V = \frac{1}{4 π ε₀} \frac{q c}{c |\vec{d}| - \vec{v} \cdot \vec{d} }

Similarly,

A = \frac{μ₀}{4 π} \frac{q c \vec{v} }{c |\vec{d}| - \vec{v} \cdot \vec{d} }

Alternatively, factoring c out of the denominator:

V = \frac{1}{4 π ε₀} \frac{q}{( |\vec{d}| - \vec{v} \cdot \vec{d}/c ) }

A = \frac{μ₀}{4 π} \frac{q \vec{v} }{( |\vec{d}| - \vec{v} \cdot \vec{d}/c ) }

Yes, which seems correct. So to present the final answer, we can use either the longer denominator or separate into terms. Then since the problem does not specify whether to use (c |\vec{d}| - \vec{v}⋅\vec{d}) or ( |\vec{d}| − (\vec{v}⋅\vec{d})/c ), we need to check the units. Hmm. Let's check.

If we keep the denominator (c |\vec{d}| - \vec{v}⋅\vec{d}), the units would be (m/s * m) - (m/s * m) → (m²/s). But the whole denominator to be have units of m²/s, but the scalar potential should have denominator in meters. Wait, no, this can't be. Wait, look:

Wait what's the associated Liénard-Wiechert denominator? In the standard expression, denominator is κ R, where κ is ( 1 - v_r/c )?

Wait no:

From Griffiths' textbook, equation 10.39:

V = (1/(4π ε₀)) ( q c / (ℛ c - ℛ ⋅ v) )

where ℛ = r - w(t_r),W here w(t_r) is the retarded position.

But Griffiths’ for that equation uses italic script r, but same as our d here.

Wait, given,

ℛ = r - w(t_r) = d,

velocity u= v.

Therefore,

he writes V= (1/(4π ε₀)) ( q c)/( ( c |ℛ| - ℛ · u) )

But wait:

Wait, in Griffiths' Edition 4, page 445 equation 10.39:

Vector potential A(r,t)= [μ₀/(4π)] [ q c v ] / ( c r - r ⋅ v )

Similarly, the same denominator ( c r - r ⋅ v ). Here, r is the vector from retarded position to the field point. So if we use ℛ for that vector,

V = 1/(4π ε₀) * [ q c ] / (c |ℛ| - ℛ ⋅ v )

A = [μ₀/(4π)] [ q c v ] / (c |ℛ| - ℛ ⋅ v )

Therefore, referring to the given variables here, since d = ℛ = vector from charge at tr to observation point, and velocities are usually denoted v. Therefore,

Griffiths' expressions would become.

V = (1/(4 π ε₀ )) * ( q c ) / ( c |d| - d ⋅ v )

A = (μ₀ / (4 π )) * ( q c v ) / ( c |d| - d ⋅ v )

But since c |d| - d ⋅v can be written as c( |d| - (d ⋅v)/c ) so factoring out c,

V = (1/(4 π ε₀ )) * q / ( |d| - d ⋅v /c )

Similarly with A raztán:

A = (μ₀ / (4 π )) * ( q v ) / ( |d| - d ⋅v /c )

But using which version? The first with c factored into the denominator, or the latter?

To check the consistency, let me check units.

For the expression with ( c |d| - d ⋅v ) in the denominator:

[ c |d| ] → [m/s * m] = m²/s

[ d ⋅v ] → [m * m/s ] = m²/s

Hence, both terms in denominator have same units, compatible. Then total denominator is m²/s. The numerator for V is q c, which is (C * m/s). So

(q c) / ( m² /s ) = C * m/s * s/m² ) = C / m. Multiplying by 1/(4 π ε₀ ), which has units of N·m²/C² → C/(V·m), giving V= (C/m )*(N·m²/C² ) = (N·m/C ) = V. So that checks out.

The first expressions from Griffiths, with c in the numerator and denominator c*s, therefore that works.

But if choosing to present denominator as ( |d| - (v ⋅d)/c ), then units:

|d| → m.

(v ⋅d)/c → (m/s * m )/(m/s ) = m, which is compatible.

So they both denominator is [m - m] → m. But then the numerator for V would be q/(4 π ε₀ ) * ...  So when matching units:

q/(4 π ε₀ * |d| - (v ⋅d / c ) ) → (C )/( (F/m * m ) - ( same ) ) → ?

Alternatively: scalar potential formula using Griffiths notation ensures unit correctness via the expression.

However, in our problem, since V and A at the observation point (r, t) are requested, and all quantities are expressed in term of d, tr, and v, both expressions are equivalent, just different arrangement. To write both versions:

Either:

V = (1 / (4 π ε₀)) * q / ( |d| - (v ⋅d)/c )

and

A = (μ₀ / (4 π )) * q v / ( |d| - (v ⋅d)/c )

OR

V = (1 / (4 π ε₀ )) * (q c )/( c |d| - v ⋅ d )

A = (μ₀ / (4 π )) * (q c v )/( c |d| - v ⋅ d )

Both are correct. It depends on the convention. To check notation in problem: c is light speed. Given that differentials like vector d, velocity v, time t, we can use either version. But users in the question didn't specify. However, considering typical notation from textbooks, and since |d| is a scalar (the distance), the second form using c |d| - v⃗ ⋅d might be appropriate?

Griffiths presents potentials written as:

V(r, t) = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q c}{(\scr{\scriptscriptstyle R} c - \scr{\scriptscriptstyle R} \cdot \mathbf{v})}, \quad \mathbf{A}(r, t) = \frac{\mu_0}{4 \pi} \frac{q c \mathbf{v}}{(\scr{\scriptscriptstyle R} c - \scr{\scriptscriptstyle R} \cdot \mathbf{v})}

where \scr{\scriptscriptstyle R} is the vector from retarded position to r.

This translates to using c |d| - \vec{d} ⋅ v in the denominator. However, if \vec{d} is defined as from retarded position to observation point, same as Griffiths' scr R.

Hence, translating this to user’s question using symbols:

V(r, t) = [1/(4 π ε₀ )] [ q c ] / (c |vec{d}| - vec{v} ⋅ vec{d} )

and similar for A.

In LaTeX:

For scalar potential:

V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q c}{c |\vec{d}| - \vec{v} \cdot \vec{d}}

Vector potential:

\vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{q c \vec{v}}{c |\vec{d}| - \vec{v} \cdot \vec{d}}

However, note that |\vec{d}| is the magnitude, so |vec{d}| = d. So if we use traditional,

But how to present these in the problem's terminology: given vector d and its magnitude.

Alternatively, in written terms using c |d| - v · d:

But since d is a vector, the term (c |d| - v · d ) is a scalar. Hmm. In vector multiplications and the denominator, but d is fixed. Therefore, is the user expecting the  retrievement as per Liénard-Wiechert using simplified denominator?

If so, both forms are acceptable, but the Villums arura mention there's also a relativistic denominator:

1/( [distance - (velocity component in direction of observation point) * (time delay) ] )

But in the problem statement, given that, yes, the key formulas are as the answer just given: 1/(4πϵ₀) * q c divided by (c |d| − \vec{v} ⋅ \vec{d}), and similarly multiply numerator and denominator by. Maybe both are correct, but next idea!

Based on the problem statement and variables given, where d is the vector from the charge's position at retarded time to the observation point, the answer is to use these variables.

In summary: express the potentials as q divided by ( (4πε₀) multiplied by ( |d| - (v ⋅ d)/c ) ) for scalar potential and μ₀/(4π) times (q v divided by same denominator for vector potential. So writing fractions in terms of permittivity and permeability:

Scalar potential,

V = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \cdot \frac{q}{|\vec{d}| - \frac{\vec{v} \cdot \vec{d}}{c}},

Vector potential,

\vec{A} = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \cdot \frac{q \vec{v}}{|\vec{d}| - \frac{\vec{v} \cdot \vec{d}}{c}}.

But, perhaps to make it look cleaner, the (vec{v} ⋅ d)/c is written as a single term.

Alternatively, Factor out |d| from the denominator:

V = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \cdot \frac{q}{|\vec{d}| \left(1 - \frac{\vec{v} \cdot \vec{d}}{c |\vec{d}|}\right)},

This could be written as:

V = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \cdot \frac{q}{|\vec{d}| \left(1 - \frac{\vec{v} \cdot \hat{d}}{c}\right)},

where hat{d} is the unit vector in the direction of d. But the problem has defined \vec{d} as that vector, so using that we have \hat{d} = \vec{d}/|\vec{d}|. But if the problem doesn't mention using unit vectors, then it's better to use the existing notation.

Given that the user includes \vec{d} but maybe doesn't assume a unit vector for it, the first form, keeping (v ⋅ d)/c in the denominator, divided by the term ( |vec{d}| - ... ) is safer.

Therefore, I think the answer is in terms of 1/(|d| - (v ⋅ d)/c )

But to write with LaTeX:

Scalar potential (V): using d\vec{} equations:

V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{\left| \vec{d} \right| - \frac{\vec{v} \cdot \vec{d}}{c}} 

Vector potential (\vec{A}):

\vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0}{4 \pi} \frac{q \vec{v}}{\left| \vec{d} \right| - \frac{\vec{v} \cdot \vec{d}}{c}} 

Alternatively, if the retarded terms s(tr) and d is given as position then perhaps confirm overlap with 
verifying it follow the traditional texts.

Yes, from Classical Electrodynamics, J.D. Jackson, equation 14.14:

\phi (\mathbf{r}, t ) = \left. \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q} { R \cdot (1 - \boldsymbol{\beta} \cdot \mathbf{n} ) } \right|_{t_ r }

where n is the unit vector in the direction of R (i.e., \mathbf{n} = \mathbf{R}/R ) , \beta is v/c. Similarly. The denominator is R (1 - \beta \cdot \mathbf{n} ) = R - R \beta \cdot \mathbf{n}  = R - (\mathbf{v}/c \cdot \mathbf{R} ). Which equals (c(t - t_r ) - ( \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{R} ) /c ), but given that R = c(t - t_r )

Wait, but that could be making it more com...

Wait, Jackson formula for LW potentials is:

\phi(\mathbf{x},t ) = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \left[ \frac{q}{ ( R - \frac{ \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{R} }{c} ) } \right]_{ret}

And similarly for A.

Absolutely so, in Jackson's book (Chap.14, sec.14.1), the potentials are expressed as:

\phi (\mathbf{x}, t) = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \left( \frac{q}{ ( R - \mathbf{\beta} \cdot \mathbf{R} ) } \right)_{\text{ret}}

and

\mathbf{A} (\mathbf{x}, t) = \frac{\mu_0 c}{4\pi} \left( \frac{q \mathbf{\beta} }{ ( R - \mathbf{\beta} \cdot \mathbf{R} ) } \right)_{\text{ret}}.

Where \mathbf{\beta} = \mathbf{v}/c and R is the scalar distance from retarded position to observation point (|d|)。But ramorra!

Therefore, yes, the denominator is R - (\mathbf{v}/c ) ⋅\mathbf{R}, which is R - ( \mathbf{v} ⋅ \mathbf{R} ) /c, which is the same as |\vec{d}| - ( \vec{v} ⋅ \vec{d} ) /c if d vector is equivalent to R. Hence, one’s spot with conclusion.

Thus, regardless of whether we arborizing |d| or R, reasons ok to bubble the expressions as:

Scalar potential:

V = (1/(4 π ε₀ )) * q / ( |d| - (vec{v} ⋅ \vec{d}) /c )

Vector potential:

vec{A} = ( μ₀/(4 π )) * ( q vec{v} ) / ( |d| - (vec{v} ⋅ \vec{d})/c )

Yes, important no square roots admit they match with Jackson and Griffiths.

Therefore, box these expressions as the answer.

**Final Answer**
The scalar potential \( V \) and vector potential \( \vec{A} \) at time \( t \) and position \( \vec{r} \) are given by:
\[
V(\vec{r}, t) = \boxed{ \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{|\vec{d}| - \frac{\vec{v} \cdot \vec{d}}{c}} }
\]
and
\[
\vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \boxed{ \frac{\mu_0}{4 \pi} \frac{q \vec{v}}{|\vec{d}| - \frac{\vec{v} \cdot \vec{d}}{c}} }.
\]
