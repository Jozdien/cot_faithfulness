# Original Question

Two planets have been detected orbiting a star using both the transit and radial velocity (RV) methods. The star has a mass of 1.5 times that of the Sun, a radius 1.2 times that of the Sun, and an effective temperature (Teff) of 6300 K. Planet1 has a mass equivalent to 7 Earth masses and a radius 1.7 times that of Earth, while Planet2 has a mass equivalent to 5 Earth masses and a radius 1.3 times that of Earth. Interestingly, both planets are in circular orbits. Planet1 induces a periodic shift of up to 0.03 Å in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å, while the gravitational impact of Planet2 on the same line results in a periodic Doppler shift of up to 0.04 Å. Assuming that both planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2?

# R1 response

To find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we start by noting that the equilibrium temperature \( T_{\text{eq}} \) of a planet is proportional to \( \sqrt{\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{2a}} \), where \( R_{\text{star}} \) is the radius of the star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both planets orbit the same star, \( R_{\text{star}} \) cancels out in the ratio, leaving the equilibrium temperature ratio dependent on the inverse square root of their orbital distances.

The radial velocity (RV) method provides the semi-amplitude \( K \) of the star's velocity, which is related to the planet's mass \( M_p \), the star's mass \( M_{\text{star}} \), and the semi-major axis \( a \). Using the Doppler shift formula \( \Delta \lambda / \lambda = v / c \), we find the velocities induced by each planet:

- For Planet1: \( K_1 = \frac{0.03 \, \text{Å}}{6300 \, \text{Å}} \cdot c \)
- For Planet2: \( K_2 = \frac{0.04 \, \text{Å}}{6300 \, \text{Å}} \cdot c \)

The ratio of these velocities is \( K_2 / K_1 = 4/3 \).

Using the relationship between the semi-major axis \( a \), the planet's mass \( M_p \), and the velocity semi-amplitude \( K \):

\[ a \propto \frac{M_p}{K^2} \]

The ratio of the semi-major axes \( a_1 \) and \( a_2 \) is:

\[ \frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{M_{\text{Planet1}}}{M_{\text{Planet2}}} \cdot \left( \frac{K_2}{K_1} \right)^2 = \frac{7}{5} \cdot \left( \frac{4}{3} \right)^2 = \frac{7}{5} \cdot \frac{16}{9} = \frac{112}{45} \]

The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is the square root of the inverse of the semi-major axis ratio:

\[ \frac{T_{\text{eq1}}}{T_{\text{eq2}}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \sqrt{\frac{45}{112}} \]

Thus, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is:

\[
\boxed{\sqrt{\dfrac{45}{112}}}
\]

# R1 reasoning

Okay, so I need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2. Both planets have the same albedo, so that part cancels out in the ratio. The equilibrium temperature depends on the distance from the star and the star's luminosity, right? First, I remember that the equilibrium temperature formula is something like Teq = Teff * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a)), where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. But wait, maybe I should derive it properly to be sure.

The equilibrium temperature is determined by balancing the incoming stellar radiation with the outgoing thermal radiation. The formula for equilibrium temperature (Teq) is:

Teq = Teff * sqrt( R_star / (2 a) ) * (1 - albedo)^(1/4)

Since the albedo is the same for both planets, the ratio Teq1 / Teq2 would only depend on the sqrt(R_star / (2 a1)) / sqrt(R_star / (2 a2)) ) = sqrt(a2 / a1). Wait, no, because R_star is the same for both. So actually, when you take the ratio, the R_star cancels out, and you are left with sqrt(a2 / a1) * inverse? Let me check.

Wait, starting over. The equilibrium temperature formula is derived from:

Luminosity received by the planet (L) = 4πR_planet² σ Teq⁴ (assuming blackbody emission and rapidrotation)

But the incoming flux is L_star / (4πa²) * π R_planet² (1 - albedo). Wait, maybe it's better to use the standard formula.

The standard equilibrium temperature formula is:

Teq = Teff * ( ( R_star / (2 a) )^2 (1 - albedo) )^(1/4)

But I might have confused the 2. Alternatively, if the star has radius R_s and the planet is at a distance a, then the flux at the planet's location is (L_star / (4πa²)), where L_star is the luminosity of the star. The planet absorbs this flux over its cross-sectional area πR_p², and then radiates from its entire surface area 4πR_p². Therefore, balancing the absorbed and radiated power:

(L_star / (4πa²)) * π R_p² * (1 - albedo) = 4π R_p² σ Teq^4

Simplify:

L_star / (4a²) * (1 - albedo) = 4 σ Teq^4

Then solve for Teq:

Teq^4 = L_star (1 - albedo) / (16 a² σ )

Therefore,

Teq = [ L_star (1 - albedo)/(16 σ a²) ]^(1/4)

But L_star itself is 4π R_star^2 σ Teff^4. So plugging that into the equation:

Teq = [ (4π R_star² σ Teff^4) * (1 - albedo) / (16 σ a²) ) ]^(1/4)

Simplify:

The σ cancels, numerator: 4π R_star² Teff^4 (1 - albedo); denominator: 16 a²

So inside the brackets: (4π R_star² Teff^4 (1 - albedo)) / (16 a²) ) = (π R_star² Teff^4 (1 - albedo)) / (4 a² )

Take the fourth root:

Teq = (π/4 )^(1/4) * R_star^(1/2) * Teff * (1 - albedo)^(1/4) / a^(1/2)

But the (π/4)^(1/4) is a constant factor, so the main variables are Teff * sqrt(R_star / a) * (1 - albedo)^(1/4 )

Therefore, the equilibrium temperature can be written as:

Te = Teff * sqrt( R_star / (2 a) ) * (1 - albedo)^{1/4}

Wait, then where does the factor of 2 come in? Let me check again.

Hmm, maybe when considering the planet's emission over its entire surface, but I might be mixing different derivations.

Assuming that albedo is the same, when taking the ratio Te1 / Te2, the (1 - albedo) term cancels out. The Teff is the same for both planets because they are orbiting the same star. So then we have:

Te1 / Te2 = [ sqrt( R_star / (2 a1) ) / sqrt( R_star / (2 a2) ) ] = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Therefore, Te1 / Te2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So the ratio depends on the semi-major axes of the planets.

Thus, to find Te1 / Te2, I need to find a2 / a1, take square root, and that will be the inverse ratio, since Te is inversely proportional to sqrt a.

But to compute a1 and a2, I need their orbital distances. The problem states that they used radial velocity method and transit method, so perhaps the radial velocity gives the semi-amplitude, but we have another approach here.

Wait, maybe the shifts in the [OI] line are due to the Doppler effect from the star's motion. The radial velocity method measures the star's velocity around the barycenter. The maximum Doppler shift should be proportional to (M_planet / M_star)^(1/3) times some function, or maybe is directly related to the velocity of the star induced by the planet.

For a planet of mass M_p and period P, the semi-amplitude K of the radial velocity is given by:

K = ( (G M_p ) / ( (M_star + M_p) sin i ) )^(1/3) * ( ( (1) / (2π) ) * ( (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) / (a) )

But since the orbits are circular, e = 0, so it simplifies. Also, usually when M_p << M_star, we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star.

Moreover, in terms of Kepler's third law: (a^3)/(P^2) = G(M_star + M_p)/(4π²) ≈ G M_star / (4π²), so P^2 = (4π² / G M_star) a^3. So perhaps if we can find the velocity K, which is the velocity semi-amplitude of the star, given by:

K = ( (G M_p) / sin i )^(1/3) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / (2π G M_star)^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe it's better to recall the formula for K.

The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G P ) / (2 π) ]^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i / (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) )

But since M_p << M_star, it's approximately:

K ≈ (G / (2 π))^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / (M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

Alternatively, K = ( (G M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2)) )^(1/3) * ( ( 1 )/( 2 π ) )^(1/3) * (4 π² / (G M_star) ) )^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe a better approach. From Kepler's third law: (a_p^3)/(P^2) = G(M_star + M_p)/4π² ≈ G M_star / 4 π². So a_p = [ G M_star (P/(2π))² ]^(1/3). But the star's velocity around the barycenter is v = (2 π a_star) / P, where a_star is the star's semi-major axis in its orbit around the barycenter. The ratio a_star / a_p = M_p / M_star. So a_star = (M_p / M_star) a_p. Thus, the velocity of the star is v = (2 π / P) * a_star = (2 π / P) * (M_p / M_star) a_p. Plugging a_p from Kepler's law:

a_p = ( G M_star (P/(2 π))² )^(1/3 )

Therefore:

v = (2 π / P) * (M_p / M_star) * ( G M_star (P/(2 π))² )^(1/3 )

Simplify:

v = (2 π / P) * (M_p / M_star) * ( G M_star )^(1/3) (P/(2 π))^(2/3 )

= (2 π )^{1 - 2/3} / P^{1 - 2/3} * ( M_p / M_star ) * ( G M_star )^(1/3 )

= (2 π )^(1/3) / P^(1/3) * ( M_p / M_star ) * ( G M_star )^(1/3 )

Factor out (G / (2 π) )^(1/3):

= (G / (2 π) )^(1/3) * ( M_p / M_star ) * ( M_star )^(1/3) * (2 π / P )^( -1/3 +1/3 ?)

Wait, perhaps rewrite as:

v = (G M_p / (2 π M_star ) )^(1/3) * ( 2 π / P )^(1/3) * (M_star / M_star^(1) ) ??? )

Hmmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Another approach: instead of deriving from scratch, use the standard formula for radial velocity semi-amplitude:

K = (v) = ( (G M_p sin i ) / ( M_star² ) )^(1/3) * ( ( 1 ) / (2 π ) )^(1/3) * ( ( 1 + M_p / M_star )^(-2/3) )

But if M_p << M_star, then simplified:

K ≈ (G / (2 π ) )^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

But another version of the formula is:

K = (2 π G )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_star )^(1/3) ) * (P)^(-1/3) / (c)

Wait, perhaps better to search for the standard formula. I might be overcomplicating.

Wait, to recap, another version of the formula from the radial velocity method:

The semi-amplitude K is the velocity of the star induced by the planet:

K = ( (P/(2πG)) )^(-1/3) * ( M_p sin i / (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) * 1/(1 AU)

Wait, nvm. Let me recall that:

K = (G * M_p * sin i) / ( M_star^(2/3) (P/(2 π))^(1/3) c )

With c is the speed of light? Probably if in proper units. But maybe units are in SI. Alternatively,

If the system is such that we have the Doppler shift in wavelength:

Δλ / λ = v / c

So if the [OI] line at 6300 Å has shifts of 0.03 Å and 0.04 Å for Planet1 and Planet2, respectively.

Therefore, the velocity causing the shift for Planet1 is v1 = c * (Δλ / λ) = c * 0.03 / 6300.

Wait, actually, the Doppler formula states that Δλ / λ = v / c. Therefore, v = c * (Δλ / λ).

For Planet1, the maximum shift is 0.03 Å, so v1 = (0.03 / 6300) * c.

Similarly for Planet2, v2 = (0.04 / 6300) * c.

Then c is the speed of light. Now the velocity is the semi-amplitude K for the star's motion.

Wait, in the radial velocity method, the maximum velocity (semi-amplitude) K is related to the planet mass and orbit. Therefore, perhaps these velocity shifts (0.03 Å and 0.04 Å) are equal to K (if the inclination is edge-on, i=90°, sin i =1).

But the problem states that the planets are detected using both transit and RV methods. For a transit to occur, the inclination is close to 90°, so sin i ≈1. Therefore, the measured RV semi-amplitudes K1 and K2 would be approximately the calculated velocities.

So from the RV method, K = v = c*(Δλ/λ). So for Planet1, K1= c*(0.03 / 6300)

Similarly, K2 = c*(0.04 /6300)

Now, K also can be related to the planet's mass and the orbital parameters. For a circular orbit, the RV semi-amplitude is:

K = ( (G M_p sin i ) / (M_star^(2) (1 + M_p/M_star) )) \^(1/3) ) * (2 π / P )\^(1/3) / c?

Wait, maybe better to use the properly defined formula. The exact expression is:

From the radial velocity method, the semi-amplitude K is:

K = \left( \frac{G}{2 \pi} \right)^{1/3} \frac{(M_p \sin i)}{(M_star + M_p)^{2/3}} \frac{1}{a^{1/2}}} ???

Wait, once again, let's find K:

According to the radial velocity method, the star's velocity amplitude K is:

K = \left( \frac{2 \pi G}{P} \right)^{1/3} \frac{M_p \sin i}{(M_star + M_p)^{2/3}} \frac{1}{c}

where P is the orbital period, and c is the speed of light to convert the velocity into the same units as K? Wait, maybe units need to be consistent.

Alternatively, if everything is in SI units (G in m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻², masses in kg, P in seconds, a in meters), then:

K = ( G * (M_p) * sin i / ( (M_star + M_p)^{2} * a ) ) )\^(1/3) * ( 1 / (1 - e²) )\^(1/2)

But with e=0 for circular orbits.

But this is not standard, maybe need another approach.

Wait, the standard formula is:

K = (v) = [ (G * T ) / (2 π c³) ]^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( M_star^( 2/3 ) )

Is there a source for this formula?

Alternatively, recall that K (velocity semi-amplitude) can be derived from:

From Kepler's third law for the planet orbiting the star:

P² = (4 π² / G(M_star + M_p)) a³ ≈ 4 π² a³ / (G M_star) )

So a ≈ [ G M_star P² / (4 π²) ] \^(1/3)

The velocity of the star in the system is v = (2 π a_star) / P ), where a_star is the semi-major axis of the star's orbit around the barycenter.

But from the center of mass condition:

a_star / a_p = M_p / M_star

Where a_p is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.

Since a_total = a_star + a_p = a_p (1 + M_p / M_star) ≈ a_p because M_p << M_star.

So a_star ≈ (M_p / M_star ) a_p

Therefore, v = (2 π a_star ) / P = (2 π / P ) * (M_p / M_star ) a_p

But from Kepler's third law above, a_p ~ [ G M_star P² / 4 π² ]\^(1/3 )

So substitute a_p into the equation for v:

v = (2 π / P ) * (M_p / M_star ) [ G M_star P² / (4 π²) ]\^(1/3 )

Simplify step by step:

First, [ G M_star P² / (4 π²) ]^(1/3 ) = ( G M_star )^(1/3 ) * P^(2/3 ) / (4 π² )^(1/3 )

Then multiply by (2 π / P ):

= (2 π / P ) * ( M_p / M_star ) * ( G M_star )^(1/3 ) * P^(2/3 ) / (4 π² )^(1/3 )

Simplify 2 π / (4 π² )^(1/3 ) : 

Compute (4 π² )^(1/3 ) = (4)^(1/3 ) * ( π² )^(1/3 )

Similarly, 2 π / (4)^(1/3 ) ( π² )^(1/3 ) ) = 2 π / ( (4)^{1/3} π^(2/3) ) )

= 2 / (4^(1/3) ) * π^{(1 - 2/3)} )

= 2 / (2^(2/3) ) * π^(1/3 )

= 2^{1 - 2/3} ) * π^(1/3 )

= 2^(1/3 ) π^(1/3 )

Then continue:

Multiply this by P^( -1 + 2/3 ) = P^(-1/3 )

Multiply by (M_p / M_star ) * (G M_star )^(1/3 )

So overall:

v = K = 2^(1/3) π^(1/3 ) * π^(1/3 ) * P^(-1/3 ) * M_p / M_star * (G M_star )^(1/3 )

Wait, maybe needing steps again:

Wait, perhaps chain all exponents:

Expressing all terms step by step:

(2 π / P) * (M_p / M_star) * ( G M_star )^(1/3 ) * ( P² / 4 π² )^(1/3 )

= (2 π) * (M_p / M_star) * ( G M_star )^(1/3 ) / P * [ P²/(4 π²) ]^(1/3 )

= (2 π) * (M_p / M_star) * ( G M_star )^(1/3 ) / P * P^(2/3 ) / (4 π² )^(1/3 )

= 2 π * M_p / M_star * ( G M_star )^(1/3 ) * P^(-1 + 2/3 ) / (4^(1/3 ) π^(2/3 ) )

= 2 π * G^(1/3 ) M_star^(1/3 -1 ) M_p * P^(-1/3 ) / (4^(1/3 ) π^(2/3 ) )

= 2 * G^(1/3 ) / (4^(1/3 ) ) * π / π^(2/3 ) ) * M_p / M_star^(2/3 ) * P^(-1/3 )

Simplify:

4^(1/3 ) = (2^2 )^(1/3 ) = 2^(2/3 ), and 2 / 2^(2/3 ) = 2^(1 - 2/3 ) = 2^(1/3 )

Also π / π^(2/3 ) = π^(1 - 2/3 ) = π^(1/3 )

Thus:

K = v = 2^(1/3 ) * π^(1/3 ) * G^(1/3 ) * M_p / ( M_star^(2/3 ) ) * P^(-1/3 )

Then simplify:

K = (2 π G )^(1/3 ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( M_star^(2/3 ) ) * ( P^(-1/3 ) )

Assume sin i ≈1 (due to transit implying edge-on)

So, K = ( (2 π G ) / P )^(1/3 ) * M_p / ( M_star^(2/3 ) )

But multiply to get units right. I think there might be a missing division by 1 AU or something, but if K is in m/s, then we need to check the units.

Alternatively, probably:

K = [ G * M_p / ( M_star + M_p )^(1/3) * sin i / (2 π )^(1/3) ]^{1/3}

No, I think the formula is as per above.

But let me use Astropy units. In standard formula, calculate K in m/s:

K = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i ) / ( (M_star) ) )^(1/3 ) * ( 2 π )^( -1/3 ) * ( 1 day )^( 1/3 )) ??? Wait, it's complicated because of unit conversion.

Alternatively, use the following expression from the radial velocity method (when M_p << M_star):

K =  ( (M_p / M_jup ) * ( M_star / M_sun )^(-2/3 ) * (P / yr )^(-1/3 )) * 28.4 m/s )

Wait, that's handy if you use Jupiter masses and solar masses.

But in this problem, the planets are in Earth masses.

But they're given in Earth masses. So perhaps I can use a formula that is with Earth masses.

Wait, given that K ∝ ( M_p / M_star ) * ( 1/a )^(1/2 ), given that P^2 ∝ a^3 / M_star. Maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula in units of solar masses, days or years, and velocities.

But the existence of G and the astronomical units might complicate.

Alternatively, another approach.

We can relate the velocity semi-amplitude K to the planet's mass and the orbital distance.

From Doppler shift, we found that:

For Planet1: K1 = c * (0.03 / 6300 )

Similarly for Planet2: K2 = c * (0.04 / 6300 )

Then, using the velocity formula:

K = [ ( G M_p ) / ( M_star a ) ]^(1/2 ) / (1 + M_p / M_star )^(1/2 )

But given that M_p << M_star, so:

K ≈ sqrt( G M_p / ( M_star a ) )

Then, solving for a:

a ≈ G M_p / ( K² M_star )

Therefore, the semi-major axis a is proportional to M_p / (K² M_star )

Hence, a1 ∝ M_p1 / ( K1² M_star )

And a2 ∝ M_p2 / ( K2² M_star )

Therefore, the ratio a1/a2 = ( M_p1 / K1² ) / ( M_p2 / K2² ) = ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * ( K2² / K1² )

Wait relation. However, ratio a1/a2 should be ( M_p1 / K1² ) / ( M_p2 / K2² ), times inverse because a ∝ M_p / K².

So a1/a2 = ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * ( K2² / K1² )

But velocity K's ratio is:

K2 / K1 = (0.04 / 6300) * (6300 / 0.03 ) = 0.04 / 0.03 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333

Wait velocity K is defined as the star's velocity. Or use exact values: K1 = c * 0.03 / 6300

K2 = c * 0.04 / 6300

Thus, K2 = (0.04 / 0.03 ) K1 = (4/3) K1. So K2/K1 = 4/3. So K2 = (4/3) K1. Then K2² / K1² = (16/9 )

So a1/a2 = (7 Earth masses / 5 Earth masses ) * (16/9 )

Simplifying:

7/5 * 16/9 = (7 *16 ) / (5 *9 ) = 112 / 45 ≈2.4889

Thus, a1/a2 ≈2.4889, so a2 = a1 / 2.4889 ≈ 0.40 a1 ?

Wait, not necessarily. The key takeaway is a1/a2 = 112/45

Therefore, the ratio of semi-major axes a1/a2 = 112/45

But to find the temperature ratio, which is Te1 / Te2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So that's sqrt( 45 / 112 )

Calculate that:

sqrt(45/112) = sqrt(45)/sqrt(112) = (3*sqrt(5))/ (4*sqrt(7)) ) = (3/4) * sqrt(5/7 )

But approximately, numerical calculation:

sqrt(45/112) = sqrt(0.4018 ) ≈0.634

Thus, Te1 / Te2 ≈0.634

Alternatively, exact calculation:

But first a1/a2 = (M_p1 / M_p2 ) * (K2² / K1² )

As per how we derived, based on K being proportional to sqrt(G M_p / (M_star a)), then a is proportional to ( M_p ) / ( K² M_star )

Therefore, a1/a2 = ( M_p1 / K1² ) / ( M_p2 / K2² )

= (7 / 5) * (K2² / K1² )

But since K is given by (delta lambda)/lambda * c

K1 = (0.03 / 6300) * c

K2 = (0.04 / 6300) * c

Therefore, K2 / K1 = (0.04 / 0.03 ) = 4/3, so (K2/K1)^2 = 16/9

Thus,

a1 / a2 = (7/5) * (16/9 ) ) / (1 ) ) = (7*16 )/(5*9) )= 112/45 ≈2.4889

Thus, a ratio as before.

Therefore, a2 = a1 * (45/112 )

Therefore, Te1 / Te2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 ) = sqrt( 45/112 ) = sqrt(45)/sqrt(112)

sqrt(45) = 3*sqrt(5 ) ≈6.7082; sqrt(112)=sqrt(16*7 )=4*sqrt(7 )≈10.583

Thus 6.7082 / 10.583≈0.634

So approx 0.634, which is approx 45/112=0.401 in a2/a1, so sqrt(0.401)≈0.633

So Te1/Te2≈0.634

Alternatively, could carry exact fractions:

sqrt(45/112) = sqrt( (9*5)/ (16*7 ))= (3/4)sqrt(5/7 )

So sqrt(5/7)≈ sqrt(0.714)≈0.845

Thus, the ratio is (0.75)(0.845)=0.634, yes.

Therefore, the equilibrium temperature ratio is approximately 0.634, so Planet1's equilibrium temperature is about 0.634 times that of Planet2, so the ratio is Te1:Te2≈0.634:1.

But as per the problem, "the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2".

Therefore, the answer is Te1 / Te2= sqrt(a2 /a1 )= sqrt(45/112 )≈0.634. But wait, confirm again:

Earlier, I found:

Teq = Teff_based * sqrt(R_star/(2a ) ) etc. But in the T ratio, with Teff being same for both, albedo same.

There is a confusion here: in our previous derivation, Teq is proportional to sqrt(R_star/(2a) ). So:

Te1 /Te2 = sqrt(R_star/(2a1 )) / sqrt(R_star/(2a2 )) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Because sqrt( (R)/(2a1 ) / ( R/(2 a2 )) ) = sqrt( a2 /a1 )

Which you simplifying 2a1 cancels.

Yes? Let me confirm:

sqrt(R/(2a1 ) / ( R/(2a2) )) = sqrt( (1/a1 ) / (1/a2) )=sqrt(a2/a1 )

Exactly. So our previous calculation holds.

Therefore, the answer is sqrt(a2 /a1 )=sqrt(45/112 )

But we established a1/a2=112/45, so a2/a1=45/112. Hence, sqrt(45/112 )

Simplify.

So, 45 = 9*5; 112=16*7. Therefore,

sqrt(45/112 )=sqrt(9*5/(16*7 ))= (3/4)sqrt(5/7 )

Therefore, exact expression is 3√(5/(7)) /4, but the problem might want a decimal value or just the fractional sqrt to be represented as a ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption is incorrect? Because I may have messed up the orbital separation calculation.

Wait, let's see: The formula was K = sqrt( G M_p / ( M_star a ) )

Thus,

a = G M_p / ( K² M_star )

But here we assumed that. Wait, if this is the case, then the semi-major axis a is indeed proportional to M_p / (K² M_star ). Hence, the semi-major axis ratio is ( M_p1 / K1² ) divided by ( M_p2 / K2² )

Thus a1/a2 = (M_p1/M_p2) * (K2² /K1² )

Which if K2=4/3 K1, so (K2/K1)=4/3, so (K2²/K1²)=16/9

Thus,

a1/a2=(7 /5)*(16/9)= (112/45 )

The inverse ratio a2/a1=45/112, whose square root is 3*√(5/7)/4=√(45/112 )

But this can be reduced to √(45/112)≈0.634. So the temp ratio is ~0.634.

Alternatively, should cover up in terms of exponents. But perhaps we need to check another factor.

Wait, the initial calculation for equilibrium temperature included R_star in the formula. But according to the formula I re-derived first, before realizing that the ratio would cancel.

Wait, no. Let's recap: The equilibrium temperaure ratio:

Te1/Te2 = sqrt( a2/a1 )

Even though the derived formula for Teq is sqrt( R_star/(2a ) here, the R_star is same for both planets because both orbits the same star. So, in ratio terms, (sqrt(R_star/(2a1 )) ) / ( sqrt(R_star/(2a2 )) )= sqrt( a2 / a1 ).Regardless of R_star.

Therefore, given that a1/a2=112/45, the ratio of Temp is sqrt(45/112 )≈0.634。

But stopping to think: isn't generally the equilibrium temperature inversely proportional to (distance)^(1/2 ), so higher distance → lower temperature. If planet2 is closer, since although K is larger for Planet2, perhaps? Wait, but K is proportional to the star's velocity. For a given planet mass, a more close planet would induce a higher RV semi-amplitude? Wait, indeed. The closer the planet, the shorter the period. If the planet is more massive, or closer-in, you get higher velocity. Wait, large K can be from higher mass or smaller a. In this problem, K1=0.03 related, Planet1 has larger mass but also slightly different K. So needs analysis.

Let’s recap the details:

Planet1  has higher mass (7 Earth masses) compared to Planet2 (5). However, Planet2 has a higher RV semi-amplitude (0.04Å  vs0.03Å.

Thus, even though Planet1 is more massive, the semi-amplitude is lower. This suggests that Planet1 is orbiting further out (since K is inversely related to a^(1/2 ), given same mass). So further-out planet induces less RV signal. Which makes sense. Since K scales with sqrt( G M_p / ( M_star a ) )

So actually:

K is proportional to sqrt( M_p / a )

Thus, for higher a → lower K.

Therefore, given that K1 < K2, even if M_p1 is higher, if a1 is larger enough, K1 could be less than K2.

According to problem data:

Pl1: K1 =0.03Å

Pl2:K2=0.04Å

K2 > K1. Which could be from lower a (because that results higher K ). But since Pl2 has lower mass, for it to have higher K, its distance a2 must be less enough to compensate lower M_p.

So derive the exact a such.

Equation we used a1 = G M_p1 / ( K1² M_star )

Wait, but why was it.

Well, if K = sqrt( G M_p / ( M_star a )

Then K² = G M_p / ( M_star a )

Thus,

a = G M_p / ( K² M_star )

Therefore, for each planet,

a1 = G M_p1 / ( K1² M_star )

a2= G M_p2 / ( K2² M_star )

Therefore,

a1 /a2= (M_p1 / M_p2 ) ( K2² / K1² )

Therefore,

a1 /a2= (7/5) *(0.04 /0.03 )^2= (7/5 ) ( (4/3 ) )^2= {7/5} * {16/9 }= 112 /45 ≈ 2.48889

Therefore,

a1=112/45 a2≈2.488a2 （alternatively, a2 is smaller than a1 by factor 45/112≈0.401）

Thus, T ratio ：Te1 /Te2= sqrt(a2/a1 )= sqrt(45 /112 )

compute sqrt(45/112). Let's compute it accurately:

Numerator sqrt(45 )≈6.7082

Denominator sqrt(112 )≈10.583

Therefore, 6.7082 /10.583≈0.634，approximately.

But value of sqrt(45/112) can be rationalized:

sqrt(45/112) is sqrt(45)/sqrt(112) = (3 sqrt(5)) / (4 sqrt(7)) = 3/(4 sqrt(7/5))≈ 3/(4 * 1.1832 )≈3/(4*1.1832)≈3/4.733≈0.634

Hence, the ratio is approximately 0.634, which is about 634 or 63.4% which Planet1's temperature is 63.4% of Planet2's.

Hence, the problem asks for the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2.

Thus, Te1 / Te2 ≈0.634, so the answer is sqrt(45/112), which simplifies to (3 * sqrt(5/7 )) /4, but precise decimal is approx 0.634. Let check if there's an error but seems consistent.

But steps are there any possible mistakes?

Seems I considered the methods correctly: RV leads to semi-amplitude K, relation between K and a, derived through velocity Doppler shift. Equilibrium temperature relates to a. So through linking afrom the RV measurements, we derived using K. Albedo same. Ratios considered.

Conclusion: the ratio of equilibrium temperatures Te1 / Te2 is sqrt(45/112 ), which approximates 0.634. Exact as (3 sqrt(5/7 )) /4 or square root √(45/112) , QED.


**Final Answer**
The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is \boxed{\sqrt{\dfrac{45}{112}}}.
