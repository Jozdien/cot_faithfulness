# R1 response

The correct IUPAC name for the described molecule is determined by analyzing the substituents and their positions on the benzene ring systematically:

1. **Identify Principal Functional Group**: The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) has the highest priority, making "benzoic acid" the parent structure. It is assigned position 1.

2. **Meta Substituents**: The carbaldehyde (-CHO) and cyano (-CN) groups are meta to the carboxylic acid and each other. Placing the carbaldehyde at position 5 and cyano at position 3 satisfies this requirement.

3. **Ortho and Para Substituents**:
   - Ortho to the carboxylic acid (position 1) are hydroxyl (-OH) at position 2 and dimethylamino (-N(CH₃)₂) at position 6.
   - Para to the carboxylic acid (position 1) is methoxy (-OCH₃) at position 4.

4. **Ortho to Cyano Group**: The methoxy group (position 4) and hydroxyl group (position 2) are both ortho to the cyano group at position 3.

5. **Numbering and Alphabetization**: Substitutents are numbered starting from the carboxylic acid (position 1). Alphabetical order (ignoring prefixes) determines the sequence in the name: cyano (C), dimethylamino (D), formyl (F), hydroxy (H), methoxy (M).

**Final IUPAC Name**:
**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**

This name accurately reflects the substituents' positions and their relationships per IUPAC nomenclature rules.

# R1 reasoning

Okay, let's try to figure out the IUPAC name for this compound. Wow, that sounds a bit complicated, but I'll take it step by step. So, the description says there's a benzene ring with several substituents: a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde, and a cyano group, all meta to each other. Then, ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino group. Also, para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group. Additionally, the methoxy and the alcohol (hydroxyl) are both ortho to the nitrile. Hmm, that's a lot. Let me visualize this.

First, the benzene ring is the parent structure. Let's start by identifying the substituents and their positions relative to each other. Let's assign numbers to the positions to make it easier.

The main substituents mentioned are:
1. Carboxylic acid (-COOH)
2. Carbaldehyde (-CHO)
3. Cyano group (-CN)
4. Hydroxyl (-OH)
5. Dimethyl amino (-N(CH3)2)
6. Methoxy (-OCH3)

All three of the carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde, and cyano groups are meta to each other. So if I put the carboxylic acid at position 1, then carbaldehyde would be at position 3, and the cyano at position 5 (since meta is positions 1,3,5). But wait, maybe alternate positions. Let me make sure. Alternatively, between three meta groups, each is separated by two positions. Let me first try to fix their positions.

Starting with the carboxylic acid at position 1. Then meta to it would be position 3 and 5. Since the carbaldehyde and cyano are also meta to each other, perhaps one is at 3 and the other at 5? Let's say carboxylic acid at 1, carbaldehyde at 3, and cyano at 5. Then the other substituents: ortho to the carboxylic acid (position 1) would be positions 2 and 6. So hydroxyl at 2 and dimethyl amino at 6?

But also, the methoxy group is para to the carboxylic acid, which is position 4. Then methoxy at position 4. Now, the methoxy (position 4) and the hydroxyl (position 2) are both ortho to the nitrile. Wait, the nitrile is at position 5. Okay, ortho to position 5 are positions 4 and 6. Methoxy is at 4, which is adjacent (ortho) to 5. And hydroxyl is at position 2, which is... oh wait, position 2 is not adjacent to 5. So this might be a conflict.

Let me double-check. The methoxy (para to the carboxylic acid at 1, so that's position 4), and both methoxy and the hydroxyl (which is at 2, ortho to the carboxylic acid) need to be ortho to the nitrile. Wait, the nitrile is supposed to be at position 5. Let's see: position 5's ortho positions are 4 and 6. Methoxy is at 4, but hydroxyl is at 2, which isn't ortho to nitrile's position unless there's a miscalculation.

Therefore, maybe my initial placement is wrong. Let's try a different configuration. Maybe the carboxylic acid is at position 1, the nitrile at 3, and the carbaldehyde at 5. Then, the groups ortho to carboxylic acid (1) would be 2 and 6. If hydroxyl is at 2 and dimethyl amino at 6. Methoxy would be para to carboxylic acid, which is at position 4. But then, methoxy is at 4 and hydroxyl at 2. The nitrile is at 3. Check ortho positions: the nitrile is at 3, so adjacent positions are 2 and 4. Methoxy at 4 is ortho to nitrile, hydroxyl at 2 is ortho to nitrile? Wait, hydroxyl is ortho to the carboxylic acid (which is at 1) and adjacent to nitrile (if nitrile is at 3). But in this arrangement, hydroxyl would be at 2, between carboxylic acid (1) and nitrile (3). So yes, hydroxyl is at 2, which is ortho to both and adjacent to both? Wait, if nitrile is at 3, hydroxyl at 2 is adjacent. Methoxy at 4 is also adjacent to nitrile at 3. So that works. Because the methoxy (para to COOH at 1, so position 4) is ortho to nitrile at 3. And the hydroxyl (ortho to COOH at 1, i.e., position 2) is ortho to nitrile at 3. So that arrangement meets the condition. 

So now, let's put all the substituents:

Position 1: -COOH (carboxylic acid)
Position 2: -OH (hydroxyl) (ortho to COOH and ortho to nitrile)
Position 3: -CN (cyano) (meta to COOH and to carbaldehyde)
Position 4: -OCH3 (methoxy) (para to COOH and ortho to nitrile)
Position 5: -CHO (carbaldehyde) (meta to COOH and to cyano)
Position 6: -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino) (ortho to COOH at position 1)

Wait, but position 6 is adjacent to COOH (1), so that's correct for the dimethyl amino group being ortho. However, we need to confirm that all groupings are correct. Let me check each condition again.

Original problem statement: 

"A benzene ring has a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde, and a cyano group all meta to one another. Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino, and para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group. The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile."

In our current setup:

- COOH (1), CHO (5), CN (3) are all meta: 1 and 3 are meta (two positions apart: 1→2→3). 1 and 5 are meta as well (1→6→5)? Wait, maybe not. Wait, actually, in benzene, meta is positions separated by two carbons, which is every other position, but if you're at 1, the meta positions are 3 and 5, no—depending on the ring numbering.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the benzene ring with numbering such that each adjacent position increments by one. So, positions 1 to 6. Let me draw this mentally:

Positions in order: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, back to 1.

The meta positions from any given position x are x+2 and x-2 (mod 6). So for position 1: meta would be 3 and 5? Because moving two positions from 1: next is 2 (ortho), then 3 (meta). The same going backwards: 6 (para), 5 (meta). So, meta positions for 1 are 3 and 5.

The three groups (COOH, CHO, CN) are all meta to one another. So each pair is meta. Hmm, but having three groups each meta to each other might not be possible unless they're in alternate positions. Wait, that's the thing. If three groups are each meta to each other, is that possible?

Wait, three meta to each other would require each of them to be separated by two positions. So perhaps at positions 1, 3, 5, but each is two apart, which would create a triangle where each is two positions apart. But wait, 1 and 3 are two apart, 3 and 5 are two apart, and 5 and 1 is four apart? Wait, no. Wait, in a hexagon, positions 1 and 3 are separated by one position (if you consider around the ring), right? 

Alternatively, perhaps the three groups are forming a 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene? In that configuration, all are equidistant. Wait, so if COOH is at 1, CHO at 3, and CN at 5, each two positions apart (meta). So yes, each pair (1-3, 3-5, 5-1) are meta? But actually, on a benzene ring, the angle between 1 and 3 is 120 degrees, which is the same as meta. So if COOH is at 1, then carbaldehyde at 3 and CN at 5. Then each of the three are each separated by two positions, so they are meta to each other. That makes sense. However, the positions 1, 3, and 5 would form 120-degree angles, each meta.

So in that case:

1: COOH
3: CHO
5: CN

Then the rest:

Ortho to COOH at 1 are positions 2 and 6. According to the problem, those are occupied by hydroxyl and dimethyl amino. Let me place hydroxyl (OH) at 2 and dimethyl amino (N(CH3)2) at 6.

Para to COOH (at 1) is position 4, which has the methoxy (OCH3).

Now, check if methoxy (4) and the hydroxyl (2) are both ortho to the CN (at 5). The CN is at 5; ortho positions to 5 are 4 and 6. The methoxy is at 4, which is ortho to 5. The hydroxyl is at 2. But position 2 is not ortho to 5. Wait, maybe a mistake here.

Wait a second, the problem states that the methoxy and the alcohol (hydroxyl) are both ortho to the nitrile (CN). 

But if the nitrile is at 5, its ortho positions are positions 4 and 6 (adjacent to 5). So methoxy is at 4: good. Hydroxyl is at 2, which is three positions away from 5. So that's not ortho. That's a problem. So perhaps this arrangement is incorrect.

I must have made a mistake in the placement. So let's backtrack.

The problem is that with COOH at 1, CHO at 3, CN at 5, we have hydroxyl at 2 and dimethyl amino at 6 (both ortho to COOH). Methoxy at 4 (para to COOH). The requirement that methoxy and hydroxyl are both ortho to nitrile (CN) isn't satisfied here, since hydroxyl is at 2, which isn't ortho to CN at 5. So maybe my initial assumption for the positions of the three meta groups is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the three meta groups are arranged in such a way that CN is in a position where its ortho positions can include both methoxy and hydroxyl. Let's see.

Suppose the arrangements is COOH at 1, then carbaldehyde and CN could be placed in such a way that the methoxy (at position 4, para to COOH) and hydroxyl (ortho to COOH, say at position 2) are both ortho to CN.

So, the positions:

COOH at 1.

Para to COOH is position 4 (OCH3).

Hydroxyl (OH) is ortho to COOH: position 2.

Dimethyl amino is also ortho to COOH, so at position 6.

Now, where can the CN and CHO be? They need to be meta to each other and to COOH. Since COOH is at 1, their meta positions would be 3 and 5.

But also, methoxy (4) and hydroxyl (2) must be ortho to CN.

If CN is at 3, its ortho positions would be 2 and 4. Perfect. Because OH is at 2 and OCH3 is at 4. Then, the carbaldehyde must be at position 5 (meta to COOH).

Wait, let's check:

COOH at 1.

Carbaldehyde (CHO) at 5 (meta to 1: that's two positions apart—1 to 5 via the ring? Wait, no, in the benzene ring, 1>2>3>4>5 is four positions apart if going clockwise, but for meta, we need two positions apart. Wait, 1 to 5 being meta: from 1, go next (2, ortho) and then next (3, meta). But 5 is the opposite direction (counterclockwise from 1: 6 (para?), 5 (meta). Wait benzene is a ring; the numbering and positions direction depends on how you label. Let's fix.

Benzene ring positions are usually numbered such that substituents are assigned numbers as low as possible. But given the complexity here, perhaps specific numbering is required.

Alternatively, how to position the groups so that all the given conditions are met. Let me re-attempt:

Let's assume substituents are as follows:

COOH is at position 1. Para is 4. Ortho to COOH can be positions 2 and 6. So OH and N(CH3)2 at 2 and 6. Let me assign places: perhaps OH at 2 and N(CH3)2 at 6. Methoxy at 4 (para). Now, we need CARBOS, CARBALDEHYDE, and CYANO all meta to each other. So three groups each separated by two positions. But we already have OH, COOH, N(CH3)2, and OCH3. Wait, three additional groups? That can’t be. Wait, the description says the benzene ring has a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde, and a cyano group. Then there's also a hydroxyl, dimethyl amino, and methoxy. So in total, six positions for substitution. Wait, but a benzene ring can only have six positions, so each position has a substituent? A benzénoides wi th six substituents? Wait, but start over: the benzene ring has the substituents discussed. Let's list them again:

- Carboxylic acid (-COOH) at position1
- Carbaldehyde (-CHO) and cyano (-CN) groups, both meta to COOH and to each other: so positions3 and5?
- Ortho to the carboxylic acid (position1) are hydroxyl (-OH) at position2 and dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) at position6.
- Para to COOH at position1 is methoxy (-OCH3) at position4.
- Methoxy (position4) and hydroxyl (position2) are also both ortho to the nitrile. So the nitrile would be at position3. Because the nitrile at position3 would have ortho positions2 and4. So position2 (hydroxyl) and4 (methoxy) are ortho to nitrile at3. BUT then where is the carbaldehyde? Since we need the carbaldehyde (CHO) also to be meta to both COOH and cyano (CN). 

CO iti on of CHO should be meta to COOH (position1) and to CN (position3). For CHO to be meta to COOH (which is at1), COOH's meta position would be 3 and 5. If it's at 5, which is meta to position1 (positions separated by two: if going clockwise, 1-2-3-4-5?) Wait, perhaps Notation-wise, numbering in a circle. 

Let me assign numbers:

Suppose the benzene ring is numbered clockwise with COOH at position1, so positions go 1 (COOH), 2 (OH),3 (CN),4 (OCH3),5 (CHO),6 (NM(CH3)2), and back to1.

Check if this arrangement meets all conditions:

- Carboxylic acid is at1, carbaldehyde at5, cyano at3. Are they all meta to each other?

Yes: position1 and3 are meta (separated by one carbon – wait, 1 and3 are two steps apart (positions|1-2-3). No, in benzene, positions are adjacent at each step. So meta is two carbons away, meaning positions1 and3 are meta, positions3 and5 are meta, positions5 and1 are meta (if the ring is numbered1,3,5... for each alternation). If positions are1,3,5, yes, each is meta. If substituted at those positions, each pair is meta.

But does this fit with our current numbering?

Wait, no, in my current numbering:

position3 (CN) and position5 (CHO): adjacent to each other through position4. Wait, position3 and5 are separated by position4, so positions3→4→5: that's adjacent. So that means3 and5 are not meta. Hence, in this numbering, their spacing is not meeting the meta requirement. Therefore, this suggests I number things incorrectly.

Hmm.

Alternative approach: Let's consider three groups that are meta: carboxylic acid at1, carbaldehyde at5, and cyano at3. To have each group meta, the others must be two positions apart. For example:

position1, then move two positions (over positions2 and3) reaching position1→3: one meta.

Similarly, position3→5: two positions (i.e., moving from3→4→5). Wait, but that’s only two, so positions3 and5 are adjacent.

But maybe benzene is a hexagonal ring: positions. Let me really imagine the benzene structure. Let me fix position1. Then positions around are1,2,3,4,5,6 clockwise.

In that case, what is meta? Being spaced two positions apart. So from position1, meta positions are position3 and position5. But if you go two positions from1, clockwise, that's position2 (ortho: adjacent), and then positon3 (meta). Going counterclockwise from1: position6 (para), but I thought maybe COOH is at1, positions next to1 being2 and6.

But let's actually map this:

Positions:

1: COOH

2: OH

3: let's say CN

4: methoxy (OCH3)

5: CHO

6: N(CH3)2

So:

1-CO-OH group at positions 1 and adjacent2(OH),6(N(CH3)2)

4: methoxy, para to COOH

3: CN

5: CHO

Check whether CN is meta to COOH. position1 to3: two apart, so yes, meta.

CHO at5: meta to COOH (positions1 and5: positions interval from1 to5. From1 going through6 to5: that's para to COOH? No, in clockwise numbering, since at1, para is position4, but going counterclockwise from1: direction depends on numbering.

Wait, perhaps one common mistake is the correct orientation of positions. When we state that something is para to a group, it's directly across (i.e., position4 if COOH at1).

But for this case, carbaldehyde (CHO) at5, is two positions away from COOH (1): so position1, then 2 and3 make two steps, but 1→6→5 is two steps counterclockwise. That's a confusion here. So depending on the order, position5 can be either two steps counterclockwise (from1) or more. Let's recap.

If we label the positions starting at1 and going clockwise:1,2,3,4,5,6. So then, para is1 and4. But meta from position1 could be3 (two steps clockwise) and5 (two steps counterclockwise from1). So, carbaldehyde is at5, which is two steps counterclockwise from1. Therefore, COOH at1→ meta to5. So that works. Similarly, between position3 and5: moving clockwise from3: positions3→4→5: that's two steps, so they are meta apart.

But in the arrangement with positions1: COOH, 3: CN, 5:CHO, would these three groups be meta to each other?

CO. 
COOH…….(1)

CHO ……….(5)

CN …........(3)

Now, each pair:

1 (COOH) and3 (CN): metb--> yes, two positions apart (1-->2-->3)

3 (CN) and5 (CHO): two positions apart (3-->4-->5)

5 (CHO) and1 (COOH): two positions apart (5-->6-->1). Hence to check: clockwise, it's pos1 and pos3, but COOH to CHO (1 to5) would be four positions apart. However, in benzene, positions can be named either direction. Wait, but according to standard practice when numbering compounds, substituents are given the lowest possible numbers, so maybe the arrangement here compels higher numbers, but under the given substitution pattern, maybe we have to proceed accordingly.

Alternatively, perhaps the displacement from COOH to CHO is actually not meta. Because if you go Clockwise from1→2→3→4→5→6:

CO. If COOH is at1 and CHO is at5, the distance from1 to5 can be done in four steps clockwise (positions1 to5 is 4 steps) or two steps counter-clockwise (1→6→5). But according to IUPAC, the substituent positions are chosen such that their numbers are as low as possible. But when multiple substituents, the lowest by seniority comes first.

So if it's necessary to place the CHO at5, depending on other substituents.

But let's temporarily put it someside.

With this current configuration, are side groups properly located?

pos4: methoxy (OCH3) which is para to COOH (correct). This methoxy group is ortho to CN at3 (yes, methoxy is 4, carbon4 is adjacent to carbon3). Methoxy at4 is ortho to nitrile at3. Also, hydroxyl (OH at2) is ortho to CN at3.OH at2, CN at3: adjacent, ortho. So that fulfills the requirement that methoxy (4) and hydroxy (2) are both ortho to nitrile (3). Then, okay. So that's good.

Carboxylic acid at1 has ortho groups at2 and6 (OH and N(CH3)2). That is as stated.

Now, the carbaldehyde (CHO) at5? Let's see, is CHO at5 meta to COOH at1? In the numbering from1 to5: 1-2-3-4-5: four steps? Or maybe thinking in terms of positions. In a hexagonal ring (benzene), positions diametrically opposite would be para, which is 1→4. For meta positions at1, positions3 and5 (obtained by moving clockwise two positions and counter two positions).

Wait, if the positions are numbered1-6 clockwise:

1: COOH

2: OH

3: CN

4: OCH3

5: CHO

6: N(CH3)2

Then between COOH (1) and CHO (5): in the ring, separation is passo two positions as counted in the other direction (taking the shortest path). So 1 <->5 would be two parts counterclockwise (1←6←5), hence meta.

CHO at5 and CN at3 would be distant two positions? From3: moving two positions to5? 3→4→5: that's two positions (meta). So CH OUAsado. Yes, they're also meta.

So all three groups (COOH at1, CN at3, CHO at5) are meta to each other. Well done, so this meets the initial condition.

So now, the entire structure should look like this:

Position1: -COOH

Position2: -OH

Position3: -CN

Position4: -OCH3

Position5: -CHO

Position6: -N(CH3)2

Now, priority-wise for substituents. Under IUPAC nomenclature, the senior substituent is the one that comes first in the order of preference. The carboxylic acid is the highest priority functional group and will be the principal functional group, so the parent chain name will be benzoic acid.

When numbering the ring, the substituents are numbered to get the lowest possible numbers. However, once the principal group is chosen (COOH in this case) it gets the lowest number possible. Then the substituents are numbered in such a way to give the lowest superscripts. But since an OH (as -ol), NH(CH3)2 (as -amino), etc., how does this affect? Let's recall the hierarchy: carboxylic acids are the highest, then sulfonic acids, then esters, then acid halides, then nitriles, then aldehydes, then ketones, then alcohols, then amines, and so on. So in order:

So in priority, COOH is the principal group, so it gets position1. Then substituents are numbered giving them as low numbers as possible.

So in our current numbering:

Position1: carboxylic acid (principal group)

the other substituents, in terms of prefixes ordered alphabetically, with their numbers.

But let's order them:

We have substituents at positions2 (OH),3 (CN),4 (OCH3),5 (CHO),6 (N(CH3)2). Wait but COOH at1, M ketuais be the principal group.

So once the principal group is fixed at1, other substituents are considered as substituents. The order in the name will be arranged alphabetically: -CHO is formyl (prefix), -CN is cyano, -N(CH3)2 is (dimethylamino), -OCH3 is methoxy, -OH is hydroxy.

So they would appear in the order as prefixes alphabetically. Alphabetically: cyano comes before dimethylamino, then formyl, then hydroxy, mathoxy...

But need to number them according to their positions. Let's check if our current nrurring gives the lowest possible numbers.

Position1: COOH is fixed.

The andere gruppën are at positions2,3,4,5,6.

But is there a way to rotate the numbering to get lower numbers for the substituents.

But since the principal group is already fixed at1 (lowest possible number), then substituents on the ring are numbered relative to 1 to give the lowest set of superscripts. The rule in IUPAC: the substituents are numbered in a way that their numbers are as low as possible, giving preference to the substituent(s) that comes first in alphabetical order. Wait, actually, no. Once the principal group is fixed, the remaining substituents are numbered in the direction that gives their locants the lowest possible numbers, starting with the first substituent encountered. The selection of direction is to give the lowest set of locants.

Alternatively, after placing the principal group (COOH) at position1, the next step is to go around the ring in such a way that the remaining substituent locants are as low as possible.

So with the current numbering:

COOH at1.

Next, going clockwise: positions2 (OH), then3 (CN),4 (OCH3), 5 (CHO),6 (N(CH3)2)

Going counterclockwise from1: position6 (N(CH3)2), 5 (CHO),4 (OCH3),3 (CN),2 (OH)

But since we have substituents in both directions, we have to determine which direction will yield the lowest locants.

Let's first look at sequential numbering:

If we enter the remaining substituents clockwise:

The substituents are at positions2,3,4,5,6.

There locants will be2,3,4,5,6.

If we number counterclockwise from1 ('n the other direction):

 substituents at position6,5,4,3,2.

Corresponding locants:6,5,4,3,2.

The idea is to compare the digit sequences.

First one: 2,3,4,5,6 vs. 6,5,4,3,2. To determine the lower order, start with the first digit. Since2 <6, the clockwise direction gives lower locants. Hence, the numbering should proceed clockwise from the principal group. So substituents are numbered as positions1 (COOH),2 (OH),3 (CN),4 (OCH3),5 (CHO),6 (N(CH3)2).

Thus, the substituents are:

- 2-hydroxy
- 3-cyano
- 4-methoxy
- 5-formyl (carbaldehyde)
- 6-(dimethylamino)

Ordering the substituents alphabetically:

C: cyano (3)

D: dimethylamino (6)

F: formyl ()5)

H: hydrox(y) (2)

M: methoxy (4)

So the order in the name would be:

cyano (3), dimethylamino (6), formyl (5), hydro XY (2), methoxy (4), benzoic acid.

So root name is benzoic acid, with substituents: 2-hydroxy,3-cyano,4-methoxy,5-formyl,6-(dimethylamino).

Putting this all together alphabetically:

The substituents are named as follows:

- dimethylamino (6)

- formyl (5)

- hydroxy (2)

- methoxy (4)

- cyano (3)

Order in name is alphabetical: so first comes cyano (C), then dimethylamino (D), then formyl (F), then hydroxy (H), then methoxy (M). Also, including their positions.

So the name would be:

3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

Yes. Let's check if all positions are bound properly.

The alternative presents:

Name: 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

But according to IUPAC rules, substituents are cited in alphabetical order, ignoring any multiplicative prefixes. So "cyano" (C) comes first, then "dimethylamino" (D), "formyl" (F), "hydroxy" (H), "methoxy" (M). The order is correct. Each substituent's position is given relative to the principal group (COOH in position1).

But maybe to check another thing: sometimes, the numbering is done in such a way that the substituents adjacent to the principal group get lower numbering. Since the principal group is at position1, is there a possible alternative numbering where this structure has smaller locants? Need to see.

In the current numbering, the substituents after COOH (position1) are positions2-6. But suppose if there's a way to have substituents with lower numbers:

If direction around the ring gives a lower set.

In some other direction. For example, if the locants of the substituents are placed in their numbering can minimize the sum or list. But once the principal group is fixed in position1, and the substituents are in positions2-6, there is no choice since the numbering must proceed from1 in either direction. As previously determined, the clockwise order from1 results in the lowest possible locants.

Okay, hence, t he name seems accurate. Hence, I'd sum:

The IUPAC name is 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

But perhaps for confirmation, verify if this setup is possible.

For example, the positions have all the groups:

1-COOH: correct.

Para to that, position4: OCH3: correct.

Ortho to COOH: positions2 (OH) and6 (N(CH3)2): correct.

Methoxy (4) andohydroxyl (2) are both ortho to nitrile at3: yes,3 is adjacent to4 and2. 

FORMYL at5 is meta to COOH and to CN (since 5 is meta on COOH (1).cehiscadghost between At5 (CHO) and 3 (CN): number of Positions fromsA to5:two steps, 3 to5 passing trough1.

Wait 3 and5 are two and a half steps apart. No, providing between3 and5.

Wait, this may Start, Ice. Let me check and s Analyse:

In a numbering going around from COOH (1):

2 – OH

3 – CN

4 – OCH3

But his you stated earlier, isn’t coRHMatter due meta? The situating is so.

Yes.

Hence, the positionierung behaves so all refutes are correctly placed, making the hoffno SCHEME correct.

Overall, I believe that the correct name is 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

However, I wonder whether alteringtheriah of substitution because of alphabetization. Wait, does ethyl’s the dimethylamino group cupied in numerals get pumped out? Sufficeorphans, Ketone, «said like». ¶

That is when you begin as header priority with week. Let me see if as per IUPAC, it\'s bicarbonate—The substitution order is etapLEX’ depends on hảojischen but alphabetisch Annual.

Chem the correct ordus tie the substituents on the role: Do we list them in alphabetical order, irrespective of posoriginal's order recogulation?

 so we need to arranged spandauhey's order as per CA alphabet, which iscræweyesalforto County's And ordered in alphabet OS.

"Cyano" comes first, then "dimethylamino"then "formyl", then "hydroxy", then "methoxy". Hence, as the name provided.

 i.e.— 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

That seems correct. That would be the IUPAC name.
