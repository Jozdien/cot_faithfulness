# R1 response

To calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction for the elastic scattering of 50 MeV electrons from a nuclear target, we use the given phase shifts \(\delta_0 = 90^\circ\), \(\delta_1 = 67^\circ\), \(\delta_2 = 55^\circ\), \(\delta_3 = 30^\circ\), and \(\delta_4 = 13^\circ\). 

The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude \( \text{Im}[f(0)] \) at scattering angle \(\theta = 0^\circ\) is given by the formula:
\[
\text{Im}[f(0)] = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^{4} (2l + 1) \sin^2(\delta_l)
\]
where \(k\) is the wave number.

First, we calculate the wave number \(k\). The electrons are relativistic since their energy (50 MeV) is much larger than their rest mass energy (0.511 MeV). The wave number \(k\) is given by:
\[
k = \frac{\sqrt{E^2 - (m_e c^2)^2}}{\hbar c}
\]
Using \(E \approx 50\) MeV and \(\hbar c \approx 197.33 \, \text{MeV fm}\), we find:
\[
k \approx \frac{50 \, \text{MeV}}{197.33 \, \text{MeV fm}} \approx 0.2534 \, \text{fm}^{-1}
\]

Next, we compute the terms \((2l + 1) \sin^2(\delta_l)\) for each \(l\):
- For \(l=0\): \( (2 \cdot 0 + 1) \sin^2(90^\circ) = 1 \cdot 1 = 1 \)
- For \(l=1\): \( (2 \cdot 1 + 1) \sin^2(67^\circ) \approx 3 \cdot (0.9205)^2 \approx 3 \cdot 0.8473 \approx 2.5419 \)
- For \(l=2\): \( (2 \cdot 2 + 1) \sin^2(55^\circ) \approx 5 \cdot (0.8192)^2 \approx 5 \cdot 0.6710 \approx 3.355 \)
- For \(l=3\): \( (2 \cdot 3 + 1) \sin^2(30^\circ) = 7 \cdot (0.5)^2 = 7 \cdot 0.25 = 1.75 \)
- For \(l=4\): \( (2 \cdot 4 + 1) \sin^2(13^\circ) \approx 9 \cdot (0.22495)^2 \approx 9 \cdot 0.0506 \approx 0.4554 \)

Summing these terms:
\[
1 + 2.5419 + 3.355 + 1.75 + 0.4554 \approx 9.1023
\]

Finally, the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is:
\[
\text{Im}[f(0)] = \frac{9.1023}{0.2534} \approx 35.89 \, \text{fm}
\]

Rounding to two significant figures, the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is:
\[
\boxed{36} \, \text{femtometers}
\]

# R1 reasoning

Okay, so I need to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude for the elastic scattering of 50 MeV electrons from a nuclear target, given the phase shifts δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. The rest of the phase shifts are to be ignored. The direction is along the incident beam, which I think means the scattering angle θ is 0°. Hmm, let me recall how scattering amplitude is related to phase shifts.

From what I remember, the scattering amplitude f(θ) in partial wave expansion is given by a sum over all angular momentum quantum numbers l. The formula is f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l P_l(cosθ), where k is the wave number, and P_l are the Legendre polynomials. But since the question is about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, maybe I can focus just on that.

The problem wants the imaginary part along the incident beam direction, so θ=0°. Let's first determine the Legendre polynomials at θ=0°. For cosθ=1. The Legendre polynomials P_l(1) are all equal to 1, right? Because P_l(1) = 1 for any l. Let me check that quickly. Yes, I think that's correct. For example, P₀(x)=1, P₁(x)=x, so at x=1, P₁(1)=1. Similarly, P₂(1)= (3*1² -1)/2 = 1, same with others. So for each l, P_l(1) = 1. That simplifies things.

So f(0°) = (1/k) Σ (2l +1 ) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l * 1. The imaginary part of f(0°) would then be (1/k) Σ (2l +1 ) Im[e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l]. Let me compute that. The e^{iδ_l} is cosδ_l + i sinδ_l, so multiplying by sinδ_l gives cosδ_l sinδ_l + i sin²δ_l. Therefore, the imaginary part is sin²δ_l.

So putting this together, Im[f(0°)] = (1/k) Σ (2l +1 ) sin²δ_l. Is that right? Let me verify:

Im[e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l] = Im[(cosδ_l + i sinδ_l) sinδ_l] = sin²δ_l + cosδ_l sinδ_l * 0 (from the real part). Wait, no, wait. Let's do that multiplication step again:

e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l = (cosδ_l + i sinδ_l) * sinδ_l = sinδ_l cosδ_l + i sin²δ_l. So indeed, the imaginary part is sin²δ_l, and the real part is sinδ_l cosδ_l. So yes, the imaginary part of each term in the sum is (2l+1) sin²δ_l. So the total is the sum over l of (2l +1) sin²δ_l divided by k. Therefore, Im[f(0)] = (1/k) Σ_{l=0}^4 (2l +1) sin²δ_l. Since the problem states to ignore the rest of the phase shifts (l > 4), so we just sum up l =0,1,2,3,4.

So now, I can compute each term. Let's note the given phase shifts:

l=0: δ₀ = 90°, so sinδ₀ = sin(90°) = 1. Therefore, sin²δ₀ = 1. The coefficient is (2*0 +1 ) = 1, so term is 1*1=1.

l=1: δ₁ =67°, sin(67°). Let me compute sin(67°). I can use a calculator here. Let's convert to radians if needed, but since sin²θ is just the square. 67°, this is approximately... Let me recall that sin(60°)=√3/2≈0.866, sin(67.5°)≈0.9239. So 67° is approximately sin(65°)≈0.9063, then each degree up is about 0.0175. Let me use a calculator for precision. 67° is 67*pi/180 radians. Let me compute sin(67):

With calculator:

sin(67°) ≈ 0.9205.

Therefore, sin²(67°) ≈(0.9205)^2≈0.8473.

Thus, the term for l=1 is (2*1+1)=3 * 0.8473≈3*0.8473≈2.5419.

l=2: δ₂=55°, sin(55°)≈0.8192. So sin²(55)≈(0.8192)^2≈0.6710. The coefficient (2*2+1)=5. Multiply: 5 * 0.6710≈3.355.

l=3: δ₃=30°, sin(30°)=0.5, sin²=0.25. Coefficient is (2*3+1)=7. So 7 * 0.25=1.75.

l=4: δ₄=13°, sin(13°). Let's calculate that. sin(13°)≈0.22495. So sin²(13°)≈(0.22495)^2≈0.0506. Coefficient is (2*4+1)=9. So 9*0.0506≈0.4554.

Now, sum all these terms:

l=0: 1.0

l=1: ~2.5419

l=2: ~3.355

l=3: 1.75

l=4: ~0.4554

Total sum: 1.0 + 2.5419 = 3.5419; +3.355=6.8969; +1.75=8.6469; +0.4554=9.1023. So approximately 9.1023. So Im[f(0)]= (1/k)*9.1023.

Now, need to compute k, the wave number. The question mentions 50 MeV electrons. Electrons are relativistic at this energy because their rest mass is about 0.511 MeV, so 50 MeV is much larger. So need to calculate the relativistic wave number.

But how?

The wave number k is given by k = p / ħc, but in nuclear physics, often the wave number k is expressed as p/ħ, but let's recall.

The momentum p for a relativistic electron can be calculated using the total energy. For electrons, the relation between total energy E, rest mass m_e c², and momentum p is E² = (pc)² + (m_e c²)².

Given E = 50 MeV, m_e c² = 0.511 MeV. So solve for p:

p = sqrt(E² - (m_e c²)^2) / c

Let me compute that.

E = 50 MeV, so E² = 2500 (MeV)².

(m_e c²)^2 = (0.511)^2 ≈0.2611 (MeV)².

So E² - (m_e c²)^2 ≈2500 -0.2611 ≈2499.7389.

Then p = sqrt(2499.7389) / c ≈49.9974 MeV/c / c ??? Wait, dimensional analysis. Wait, normally, E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2, so p = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2)/c. So p should be in units of MeV/c. Let's calculate:

sqrt(2499.7389) ≈ 49.9974. Therefore, p≈49.9974 MeV/c /c? Wait, no. If the equation is E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2, then p = sqrt(E² - (m c^2)^2)/c, so p is in units [MeV/c] divided by c, so p ≈ sqrt(2500 MeV² - 0.2611 MeV²)/c ≈ 50 MeV / c. Because 50^2 is 2500. So, approximates to 50 / c MeV. Because m_e c² is negligible compared to E here, so non-relativistically would not be correct, but we considered the relativistic expression.

Wait, no. Let's be precise. So:

p = sqrt( (E/c)^2 - (m_e c)^2 ). Wait, perhaps I messed up the units. Maybe better to work in SI units.

But maybe it's easier to use natural units where ħc ≈ 197.33 MeV fm. Let's use that.

So, for momentum p in [MeV/c], then the wave number k is p / ħ, where ħc ≈197.33 MeV fm. Therefore, k = (p [MeV/c]) / (ħc / c) = (p [MeV/c]) / (ħc / c) ??? Wait, confusing. Let me think.

Given that in natural units ħc ≈197.33 MeV fm. So for momentum p in [MeV/c], multiplying by ħc converts it to [MeV/c * MeV fm] = (MeV)^2 fm /c. Wait, confusion arises.

Wait, wave number k is 2π/λ, and λ is the de Broglie wavelength. The de Broglie wavelength λ=h/p, so k = p / ħ. In units where ħ is in [MeV s], so need to ensure the units are consistent.

Alternatively, since k is p / ħ, but in order to compute k in [fm^{-1}], since we have energies in MeV and ħc≈197.33 MeV fm.

Thus:

p is in [MeV/c], and ħc is in [MeV fm], so k can be calculated as:

k = p / ħc * c = (p / (MeV/c)) * (MeV fm / (ħc)) ) )

Wait, maybe if we express k in terms of p using the relation k = p / ħ, and considering units.

Since ħc = 197.33 MeV fm, so ħ = ħc / c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm / (c). Therefore, c=3e8 m/s approximately, but here perhaps the unit conversion is handled via MeV fm.

Wait, maybe a shortcut. Let's use the relativistic momentum p.

We can take the following approach: since the total energy E = 50 MeV.

But for ultra-relativistic particles, E ≈ pc, so p ≈ E / c. However, since the electron is not ultra-relativistic here (50 MeV vs 0.511 MeV), wait, but 50 / 0.511 ≈ 97.84 >> 1. So it's highly relativistic. So maybe p ≈ E/c would be a good approximation?

But let's check:

If E = 50 MeV = gamma m_e c²,

So gamma = 50 / 0.511 ≈97.847.

Then, gamma >>1, so p ≈ gamma m_e c ≈ (50 / 0.511) m_e c.

But m_e c in [MeV/c^2] * c = m_e c² / c = 0.511 MeV / c. So p ≈ gamma * 0.511 MeV / c ≈ (50 / 0.511)*0.511 MeV /c =50 MeV/c. Wait, that's circular? Hmm, but actually:

gamma = E / m_e c² = 50 / 0.511 ≈97.847

Then, p = gamma m_e v. But for ultra-relativistic, v ≈c, so p ≈ gamma m_e c.

But m_e c is in units kg m/s, not helpful. Let's compute p in terms of MeV/c.

Since p c = sqrt(E^2 - (m_e c^2)^2 )

As above:

p c = sqrt( (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(2500 -0.261)≈sqrt(2499.739)≈49.9974≈50. So p =50 / c. So p ≈50 MeV / c.

Therefore, p ≈50 MeV/c.

Hence, k, which is p / ħ, but in units, we have ħc ≈197.33 MeV fm. Therefore, ħ = ħc /c ≈197.33 MeV fm / c. Then,

k = p / ħ = (50 MeV/c ) / (197.33 MeV fm / c ) = 50 / 197.33 fm^{-1} ≈0.2534 fm⁻¹.

So k ≈0.2534 fm⁻¹.

Wait, let me check that in another way.

Since ħc ≈197.33 MeV fm, then:

so for p=50 MeV/c,

k = p / (ħ c) * c = (50 MeV/c ) * c / (ħ c^2 ) ??? That seems confused. Another approach:

We have k = p / ħ.

But c is the speed of light. Let's write ħ as ħ = ħc / c ≈197.33 MeV fm / c. So,

k = p / (ħc / c) ) * c )? Wait not sure.

Alternatively: Since ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm, so:

If p =50 MeV / c,

Then, (p c) = 50 MeV.

But k is related to (p c) via [(p c) = ħ c k].

Therefore,

k = (p c) / (ħ c) = p / ħ.

Wait, p is in [MeV/c], then p c = MeV.

So, using that p c = ħ c k,

So k = p c / (ħ c) ) =p / ħ.

But ħ is given in [MeV fm / c] (since ħc ~197.33 MeV fm).

Wait this is getting tangled. Maybe the most straightforward way: since we have k = p / ħ. So convert p to [MeV/c], and ħ is ~197.33 MeV·fm/c. So ħ ~197.33 MeV·fm/c. Therefore, [MeV/c]/[MeV·fm/c] = 1/fm. Therefore,

k = (50 MeV/c ) / (197.33 MeV·fm / c ) = (50 /197.33) /fm ≈0.2534 fm⁻¹. Yep, that's correct. Alright, so k ≈0.2534 fm⁻¹.

Therefore, "Im[f(0)] = (1/k) * 9.1023 ≈ (1/0.2534 fm⁻¹) *9.1023 ≈ (1 /0.2534)*9.1023 fm ≈3.944 *9.1023 fm ≈35.89 fm.

But wait, in scattering theory, what are the units of the scattering amplitude? The scattering amplitude f(θ) has units of length. So here, with the calculation we get the Im[f(0)] in fm (femtometers), which is correct. However, in some conventions, the scattering amplitude f(θ) is in units of inverse length (if one divides by the wave number), but I need to check the formula again.

Wait hold on, the formula was f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (2l +1 ) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l P_l(cosθ). Yes, so 1/k has units of length (since k is inverse length), so f(θ) has units of length. Therefore, f(θ) in units of fm.

So finally, integrating all, Im[f(0)] ≈35.89 fm. But wait, hold on. Let me check the arithmetic again. So, sum of (2l+1) sin²deltal:

l=0: 1*(1)=1

l=1:3*(0.9205)^2≈3*0.847≈2.542

l=2:5*(sin(55))²≈5*(0.8192)^2≈5*0.671≈3.355

l=3:7*(0.5)^2=7*0.25=1.75

l=4:9*(sin(13°))²≈9*(0.22495)^2≈9*0.0506≈0.455

Total:1+2.542=3.542; +3.355=6.897; +1.75=8.647; +0.455=9.102

So total sum ≈9.102

Hence Im[f(0)]= (9.102)/k ≈9.102 /0.2534 fm⁻¹ ≈35.89 fm.

But 35.89 fm is pretty large. Wait femtometers. The nuclear radius is usually on the order of several fm. For example, a nucleus with A=100 has radius ~5 fm. So a scattering amplitude of 35 fm seems quite large, but due to summing multiple phase shifts. Not sure. But maybe it is correct.

Alternatively, whether there is an additional factor? Let me confirm the formula for Im[f(0)].

Wait, from optical theorem, the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude is related to the total cross-section. The optical theorem states that Im[f(0)] = (k/(4π)) σ_total. So if I can also compute that for double-check.

But since this is elastic scattering and the problem gives phase shifts, which imply there are no absorption (imaginary phase shifts). Wait, but here the phase shifts are real. So the total cross-section should be the sum over (4π/k²)(2l+1)sin²δ_l. Then indeed:

σ_total = 4π/k² Σ (2l+1) sin²δ_l .

But according to optical theorem,

Im[f(0)] =k/(4π) * σ_total =k/(4π)*(4π/k²) Σ (2l+1) sin²δ_l )= Σ (2l+1) sin²δ_l /k.

Which matches exactly what we computed above. So that cross check holds.

So therefore, my calculation is correct. So since the numbers give us Σ (2l+1) sin²δ_l= approx9.102, so Im[f(0)] =9.102/k. Therefore, using k=0.2534 fm⁻¹:

Im[f(0)]=9.102 /0.2534 ≈35.89 fm.

But to present this in the problem's context, we need to express the answer in terms of its unit. 50 MeV electrons. Maybe converting it into barns or anything else? No, the answer is just the imaginary part in fm. If required, 35.89 fm, but must check calculation steps again for possible miscalculations.

Alternatively, sometimes scattering amplitude is given in units related to the reduced wavelength or something, but in the expression derived, it's (1/k) multiplied by the sum. Given k is in fm^{-1}, 1/k is in fm, then the answer is in fm. So 35.89 fm.

But let me re-check my a駇rithmetic for sin(67 degrees). Let me compute sin^2(67°):

sin(67°) = sin(60° +7°). Sin(a+b)= sin a cos b + cos a sin b.

= sin60 cos7 + cos60 sin7

sqrt(3)/2 * 0.99255 +0.5*0.12187

≈0.8660*0.9925 ≈0.86, and 0.5*0.1218≈0.0609. Total≈0.86+0.0609≈0.921.

So sin(67°)≈0.921, squared≈0.848. So term for l=1, (2*1+1)=3, so 3*0.848≈2.544. Our approximate calculation earlier.

Similarly, l=2: sin(55°). Let's compute sin(55°).

Sin(55°)=sin(54°+1°)=sin54≈0.8090, cos54≈0.5878.

Taking sin54≈0.8090, sin55≈ sin54 + 1°*cos54 * (π/180)

Which is ≈0.8090 + 0.5878*(0.01745)≈0.8090 +0.01025≈0.8193. Which aligns with my calculator value earlier. So sin²(55°)= (0.8192)^2≈0.671. So term is 5*0.671≈3.355. Correct.

Move to next l=3, sin(30)=0.5, squared is 0.25. 7*0.25=1.75. Correct.

l=4, sin13°: 0.22495, squared≈0.0506, 9*0.0506=0.455. Correct.

Sum=9.102. Alright.

k=0.2534 fm⁻¹ ( because p≈50 MeV/c, so k= p/ħ = (50 MeV/c)/(197.33 MeV fm /c )=0.2534 fm⁻¹). Then, 9.102/0.2534≈35.89. So, 35.89 fm is correct.

But let's verify with the optical theorem. Compute the total cross-section, σ_total=4π/k² Σ (2l+1) sin²δ_l. Then, 4π/(0.2534)^2 *9.102~units: [fm^2].

But (k is in fm⁻¹, so 1/k is fm, and so 1/k² is fm². So 4π*(1/k²)*sum. So:

4π*(9.102)/(0.2534)^2≈4*3.1416*9.102/(0.06421)≈12.566*9.102/0.06421≈114.37/0.06421≅1779 fm². Convert to barns: 1 barn =100 fm², so ~17.79 barns. That seems really large for electron scattering. For nuclei, the cross sections are typically on the order of barns (for strong interactions), but this is electron scattering which is electromagnetic, and cross-sections can be smaller. Wait, but let's think, 50 MeV electrons. The cross sections are generally around millibarns for EMS, but perhaps with the phase shifts provided up to l=4, the sum accumulates to higher value.

But maybe in the problem. Let's check if σ_total=4π/k² Σ has no misunderstandings.

Because normally, cross sections in electron scattering can vary, depending on nucleus and energy. However, regardles, this is actually an elastic cross section. If all phase shifts are elastic (as stated, elastic scattering), then σ_total is the total elastic cross section.

But Im[f(0)] = kev/(4π) σ_total. Then, changing back: => If σ_total=16 barns, as per the calculation, then. However, scattering cross sections in electron scattering do vary. Let's not overthink. Our job is to compute the Im[f(0)] and perhaps present it as 35.89 fm.

But maybe in the given wave number should use something slightly different. Wait, might there be a miscalculation in p? For 50 MeV electrons:

Recheck.

Electron kinetic energy T=50 MeV. Wait, sometimes energy given is kinetic, sometimes total. Given the problem mentions that the electrons are 50 MeV, but for high-energy electrons (relativistic), the kinetic energy is approximate to the total energy, but let me reconfirm:

If it is kinetic energy T, then total energy E = T + m_e c²=50 +0.511≈50.511 MeV.

Then momentum p is sqrt(E² - (m_e c²)^2)/c= sqrt((50.511)^2 - (0.511)^2)/c.

But 50.511^2 ≈2551.4, (0.511)^2≈0.261, sqrt(2551.4-0.261)≈sqrt(2551.14≈50.506).

So p≈50.506/c≈50.5 MeV/c.

Hence k= p/ (ħc / c ?) wait, with the same formula, ħc=197.33 MeV fm,

p=50.506 MeV/c,

Wait unit analysis:

p [MeV/c]

ħc=197.33 MeV fm

Therefore, k = p / ( ħc )^{something}

Wait, more carefully: Planck constant h = 2πħ.

The de Broglie wavelength λ = h/p.

Wave number k = 2π/λ=2π/(h/p)=p/(ħ)。

So k= p/(ħ)..

However, if p is in MeV/c, we need ħ in units that allows k to have units fm^{-1}.

But since ħc≈197.33 MeV fm, therefore,ħ= ħc / c ≈197.33 MeV fm /c.

Therefore:

k= p / ħ = p *c / (ħc).

Since ħ= ħc /c, so ħ=197.33 MeV fm /c.

Therefore, k=pc / (ħc) *c^(-1) [since p/ħ is (MeV/c)/ (MeV fm/c) )= (1/fm).

Wait, actually:

Let me take p in [MeV/c].

Then, ħ in units of [MeV s], but through ħc=197.33 MeV fm, so ħ=ħc/(c)=197.33 MeV fm/c.

Therefore, then k= p / ħ = (MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV fm / c )= 1/(197.33) *c^2 / MeV. Wait not sure.

Alternatively, write:

The de Broglie wavelength λ= h/p =2πħ/p. Hence, k=2π/λ= p/ħ.

But using ħc≈197.33MeV fm, then:

k= p / (ħc /c ) )= p c/(ħc )

Since p is [MeV/c], multiplied by c is MeV, and then divided by [ħc= MeV fm], gives:

k= (p in MeV/c)*c / (MeV fm ))= (MeV/fm ) * c / (MeV/fm·c) ) hmm, confusing.

Alternatively,

k =p c / ħc

Since pc here, from the calculation for E=50.511 MeV, which was when T=50 MeV, pc≈50.511 MeV.

Thus, k=pc/(ħc)*1/fm =

pc=50.511 MeV,

so k=50.511 /197.33≈0.2559 fm⁻¹.

Thus more accurately, k≈0.256 fm⁻¹. Slightly higher than before. But if the initial calculation was done using T=50 MeV as total E, which is an easy mistake. Wait. Wait——in the calculation for p, do we need to take into account if the energy is kinetic or total?

This is key here. The problem says "50 MeV electrons", but does this mean kinetic energy or total energy?

In high-energy physics, when we say the energy of a particle, we are usually referring to the kinetic energy. So here, if the kinetic energy T=50 MeV, then total energy E=T+m_e c²=50 +0.511=50.511 MeV.

Alternatively, if it's meant to be total energy (unlikely). The initial treatment assumed 50 MeV as total energy which leads p≈50 MeV/c. Butp this determination actually depend on how does k look like.

But as it turns out, if kinetic energy is considered, k≈0.2559fm^{-1}, which still close to my initial calculation of ~0.2534.

So instead of measuring imaginary part by 30 femtometers, maybe it should be a bit higher. Let's setimate:

If k=0.2559, Im f(0)=9.102 /0.2559≈35.55 fm.

Which is still≈35.5 fm. So the first calculation of 35.89 with k=0.2534. There's not much difference. The biggest uncertainty is maybe an order of magnitude, but within factors, the numbers agreed.

Alternatively, perhaps they wanted non-relativistic calculation. Let's check that.

LOL，非相对论？For non-relativistic electrons:

p=√(2m_e T), but T=50 MeVn compares to m_e c²=0.511 MeV. The speed is so high that it's ultra-relativistic.

But just as a curiosity, non-relativistic k would be p/ħ= sqrt(2m_e T). / ħ.

But converting T into mks units: thus need meter, kg, sec.

But we can use:

m_e c² =0.511 MeV≈0.511×1e6 eV ×1.602e-19 J/eV ≈8.187e-14 J.

So m_e= (m_e c²)/c²≈8.187e-14 J / (9e16 m²/s²)≈9.096e-31 kg.

If the kinetic energy is T=50 MeV=50×1e6×1.602e-19 J=8.01e-13 J.

Non-relativistically, p= sqrt(2m_e T)= sqrt(2*9.096e-31 kg *8.01e-13 J)=sqrt(1.457e-42 kg J)=approx 1.207e-21 kg m/s.

Then wavelengths lambda= h/p=6.626e-34 Js /1.207e-21 kg m/s≈5.49e-13 m=5.49e-2 fm. So k=2pi/lambda≈1.145e+13 m^{-1}=1.145e+28 fm^{-1}? Obviously way too large.

But utterly unrealistic. This particle being highly relativistic. Of course, no sense. Reject non-relativistic calculation.

Therefore, we should proceed with the initial relativistic evaluation.

Wait, but another possible approach： k in the wave number can be approximated for high-energy electrons as:

Since the electron energy is much higher than its rest mass, E ≈ pc, so:

k≈E/(ħ c).

So if E=50MeV, then k=50/(197.33)≈0.2534 fm⁻¹. Which aligns with previous method.

Therefore, regardless of whether energy is considered as total or kinetic, since even if it's total energy=50 MeV+0.511=50.511 MeV, the value of k becomes slightly higher (≈0.256) but well within we can say approximately 0.2534.

Given the negligible difference compared to 0.2534, So proceed with k=0.2534 fm⁻¹.

Consequently，Im[f(0)]≈35.89 fm.

Expressed in femtometers, possibly rounded.

But  asked to ignore the rest of the phase shifts, which we did. All given phase shifts summed.

Therefore final answer is around 36 fm. Depending on precise decimal places. Let me check precise sin calculations.

Two ways to get more accuracy.

Use calculator for each sine squared (degrees):

Delta0=90°: sin²(90)=1.

Delta1=67°: sin(67°)= let me check calculator:

Sin 67deg= 0.9205 methylocalculations. Square is 0.8473 ; 3 *0.8473=2.5419.

Delta2:55°, sin(55)=0.8192; sin^2=0.6710; 5*0.6710≈3.355.

Delta3: 30°, sin²=0.25; 7*0.25=1.75.

Delta4:13°, sin(13)=0.22495，square=0.0506;9*0.0506≈0.4554.

Total sum≈9.1023, so same. Thus rounded to IT four significant digits, that's approximately9.102.

Then k must use precise evaluation.

Wait, in the calculation with E_true=50.511 MeV:

E_total=50 +0.511=50.511 MeV.

Thus pc= sqrt(E_total^2 -- m_e²c^4)=sqrt(E_total² - (m_e c²)^2)= sqrt(50.511^2 -0.511^2)=sqrt(2551.46-0.261)=sqrt(2551.199)=approx50.51 MeV.

Hence p=50.51/c MeV/c.

Which gives k=p/lambda. Let's compute k:

k= p / ħc=(50.51 MeV/c )/(198でおこなれたでは??

Wait, sinceħc=197.33 MeV fm.

So k equals pc / ħc? Wait sorry, if p =50.51 MeV/c, then in terms of energy, pc=50.51 MeV.

But we have k = p / ħ. However，

Using more precisely,

k= (E_total^2 - m_e²c^4)^{1/2}/ (ħ c^2). No:

Wait, here's how:

Relativistic relations: E_total²=(pc)^2 + (m_e c²)^2.

Thus pc= sqrt(E_total² - (m_e c²)^2)

Hence p= sqrt(E_total² - (m_e c²)^2)/c

Thus,

k= p / ħ=  sqrt(E_total² - (m_e c²)^2 ) / (ħ c )

But since  we are likely given thatħc=197.33 MeV fm，

Then replacing c with units:

k= sqrt(E_total² - m_e²c^4) / (ħ c )
=
sqrt( (E_total)^2 - (m_e c²)^2 ) / (ħc )

So,

k= sqrt( (50 +0.511)^2 -0.511^2 ) /197.33 [MeV/ (MeV fm) )]

Compute numerator:

(50.511)^2 -0.511^2 = (50.511 -0.511)(50.511 + 0.511)=50*51.022≈50*51.022≈2551.1.

Hence sqrt(2551.1.)≈50.508。

Thus,

k=50.508 [MeV] /197.33 [MeV fm] =50.508/197.33=0.2560 fm^{-1}

Therefore,

Im[f(0)]=9.1023 /0.2560≈35.85 fm≈35.9 fm.

If rounded to three significant digits ≈35.9 fm.

Alternatively, at this point, given the input phase shifts are provided in degrees as integers except for 55° which is possibly somewhere (but possibly typo, as probably it's also integers), but assuming all del fltà are exact.

But likely, the proper result after accurate calculation is 35.9 fm. Since Σ( terms)=9.1023,age. Compute always possible that if the student uses approximate values, let me summarize.

Alternatively, this should all be done with more precise sine terms.

Consider using accurate sine squared:

l=1, delta1=67°.

sin(67)^2 = sin^2(67*pi/180)=sin^2(1.16937 radians):

Calculate in radians.

Not converting, sinuses of certain degree:

Alternatively, use known that sin(67)=sin(45+22)=sin45cos22+cos45sin22. But complicated.

Alternatively, compute numerically:

In degrees, calculate sin(67):

A trim, pair value snakeys. However, but as we're relying on calculator entry for precise value.

Alternatively, use exact calculation:

But line, depth finalizing, eb.comforter calculating This brings to mind though that maybe implicit in assuming sin(67)=0.9205. Let me check itsquare is 0.8473.

So the final verity—unless there's a commandingly big mistake in calculations—is approximately that.

Therefore, boxing the final answer.

**Final Answer**

The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction is \boxed{36} femtometers.
