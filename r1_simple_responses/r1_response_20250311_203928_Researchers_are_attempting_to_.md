# Original Question

Researchers are attempting to detect transits of two Earth-like planets: Planet_1 and Planet_2. They have limited observing time and want to observe the one that has the highest probability of transiting. Both of these planets have already been detected via the RV method, allowing us to know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Although both planets share the same masses, the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2. Interestingly, they both have circular orbits. Furthermore, we know the masses and radii of the host stars of these two planets. The star hosting Planet_1 has a mass that is twice that of the host star of Planet_2. As the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved, both host stars have the same radii. Based on the provided information, the researchers have chosen to observe:

To determine which planet has the highest probability of transiting, we need to compare the transit probabilities of Planet_1 and Planet_2. The transit probability for a planet in a circular orbit is approximately given by \(\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a}\), where \(R_{\text{star}}\) is the radius of the host star and \(a\) is the orbital semi-major axis. 

Given:
- Both host stars have the same radii.
- Planet_1's orbital period (\(P_1\)) is three times shorter than Planet_2's (\(P_2\)).
- The host star of Planet_1 has twice the mass of the host star of Planet_2 (\(M_1 = 2M_2\)).

Using Kepler's third law for both planets:
\[
P^2 = \frac{4\pi^2 a^3}{G M_{\text{star}}}
\]

For Planet_1:
\[
P_1^2 = \frac{4\pi^2 a_1^3}{G M_1}
\]

For Planet_2:
\[
P_2^2 = \frac{4\pi^2 a_2^3}{G M_2}
\]

Considering \(P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3}\) and \(M_1 = 2M_2\), we solve for the ratio \(a_1/a_2\):

\[
\left(\frac{a_1}{a_2}\right)^3 = \frac{M_1}{M_2} \left(\frac{P_1}{P_2}\right)^2 = 2 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{2}{9}
\]

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.634
\]

Since \(a_1 \approx 0.634a_2\) and both host stars have the same radii, the transit probability is inversely proportional to the semi-major axis. Therefore, Planet_1, being closer to its host star, has a higher transit probability.

\[
\text{Transit probability} \propto \frac{1}{a}
\]

Thus, the researchers should observe \(\boxed{Planet_1}\).

# R1 reasoning

Alright, let's see. So the question is about determining which planet, Planet_1 or Planet_2, has a higher probability of transiting. The researchers want to maximize their chances of observing a transit, so they should pick the planet with the highest transit probability. 

First, I need to recall what factors affect the transit probability. From what I remember, the probability that a planet transits its host star from our viewpoint depends on the alignment of the orbital plane. If the orbital plane is edge-on relative to us, transits occur. The probability is related to how likely such an alignment is, which, for a circular orbit, depends on the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance. 

The formula for transit probability, if I recall correctly, is approximately (R_star + R_planet) / a, where R_star is the star's radius, R_planet is the planet's radius, and a is the orbital semi-major axis. Since the planets are Earth-like, their radii are much smaller than their host stars', so R_planet can be neglected, simplifying the probability to R_star / a. Therefore, the main factors are the star's radius and the orbital distance of the planet. 

But wait, both host stars have the same radii. The problem states: "both host stars have the same radii." That's an important point. So R_star is the same for both. Then their transit probabilities depend inversely on their orbital distances. The planet with the smaller semi-major axis (i.e., the one closer to its star) will have a higher transit probability. Since Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period than Planet_2 (specifically, three times shorter), I need to figure out how the semi-major axes compare. 

To relate orbital period to semi-major axis, I use Kepler's third law. The formula is P^2 = (4π²/G(M_star + M_planet)) * a^3. Since the planet mass is much smaller than the star's mass, M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. But Planet_1's host star has twice the mass of Planet_2's host star. Let me write out the equations:

For Planet_1: P1² = (4π²/(G*M1)) * a1³

For Planet_2: P2² = (4π²/(G*M2)) * a2³

Given that M1 = 2*M2 and P1 = P2/3. 

We need to express a1 and a2 in terms of the given variables and then compare them. Let me solve for a in each case:

From Kepler's third law: a^3 = (G*M*P²)/(4π²)

Therefore, a = [G*M*P²/(4π²)]^(1/3)

So for Planet_1, a1 = [G*M1*P1²/(4π²)]^(1/3) = [G*(2*M2)*(P2/3)²/(4π²)]^(1/3)

And Planet_2's a2 = [G*M2*P2²/(4π²)]^(1/3)

Let me compute the ratio a1/a2:

a1/a2 = [ (2*M2*(P2/3)²) / (M2*P2²) ) ] ^ (1/3)

Simplify inside the brackets:

= [2/(3²)] = 2/9

So a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3). Let me compute that:

Cube root of 2 is approximately 1.26, cube root of 9 is approximately 2.08, so 1.26/2.08 ≈ 0.606.

So a1 ≈ 0.606 * a2. Thus, Planet_1 is closer to its star than Planet_2. Since R_star is the same for both, the transit probability for Planet_1 is R_star/a1, and for Planet_2 is R_star/a2.

Therefore, as a1 < a2, R_star/a1 > R_star/a2. So the transit probability is higher for Planet_1.

But wait! Let me make sure. The star radius is the same for both, but what is the actual value? Since the star for Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star, but they have the same radii. Normally, more massive stars are larger, but in this case, they specified that the host star of Planet_2 is slightly evolved, which can expand. So perhaps even though Planet_1's star is more massive, they have the same radius. So R is same for both.

Therefore, since transit probability is inversely proportional to a, Planet_1's closer orbit gives it a higher transit probability.

But let me check the steps again. Comparing P1 and P2 with the different stellar masses. For a given period, planet around a more massive star would be further out, because a scales with (M*P²)^(1/3). However, in this case, Planet_1's period is 3 times shorter. So even with a higher mass star, the shorter period might make its orbit closer.

Yes, indeed, calculated as above, Planet_1's a is about 0.6 times a2, so a1 is smaller. Hence, higher transit probability. So the answer would be Planet_1?

Wait, but let me re-examine. The problem says the star hosting Planet_1 has a mass twice that of the host star of Planet_2. So M1 = 2*M2. The periods are P1 = (1/3)*P2. So let's write Kepler's third law for both:

a1^3 = (G*M1*P1²)/(4π²)

a2^3 = (G*M2*P2²)/(4π²)

Compute the ratio (a1/a2)^3 = (M1/M2)*(P1/P2)²

Given M1/M2=2, P1/P2=1/3.

Therefore, (a1/a2)^3 = 2*(1/3)^2 = 2/9

So the ratio a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ 0.634, as calculated. Thus a1 is 0.634*a2. Which means a1 < a2.

Since R is the same, transit probability R/a for Planet_1 is higher.

Therefore, transit probability is higher for Planet_1, so they should observe Planet_1.

Wait, but there's another factor: the impact parameter. The transit probability also depends on the relative alignment. For circular orbits, the probability is (R_star + R_planet)/a, which is approximately R*/a. So even considering that, since R* is same, a1 is smaller, higher probability.

Hence, the planet with higher probability is Planet_1, correct?

Hmm, let me check if any other parameters affect transit probability. Also, perhaps the orbital velocity, but no, the time it transits is a geometric probability calculated based on the solid angle from which transit is possible, which is proportional to R/a.

Hence, I think Planet_1 has higher probability. Therefore, the answer should be Planet_1. So the researchers should observe Planet_1.

But let me double-check if I considered all factors properly:

Star mass comes into play in Kepler's law, which affects the semi-major axis. Planet_1's host being more massive would require planets in shorter orbits to have the same period. But since Planet 1 has a shorter period (3x shorter), the semi-major axis adjusts based on the mass and period.

Looking back, if two bodies with same R, then closer-in planet (smaller a) has higher probability. So as Planet_1 is around a more massive star but with 3x shorter period, the result is Planet_1 has a smaller a. Therefore, higher transit probability.

Yes, so the conclusion should be Planet_1.

**Final Answer**
The researchers should observe \boxed{Planet_1}.
