# Original Question

Two stars (Star_1 and Star_2) each have masses 1.5 and 1.2 times that of our Sun, respectively. Assuming LTE and using the EW method, astronomers have determined the elemental abundances of these two stars: [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex, and [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. Consider the following photospheric composition for the Sun: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 and 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7. Calculate the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2.

# R1 response

The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is determined by comparing their silicon abundances relative to hydrogen ([Si/H]) derived from the given elemental abundance data.

1. **For Star_1:**
   - Given [Fe/H]_1 = 0, the iron abundance relative to hydrogen is the same as the Sun: \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}})_1 = \log_{10}(n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}})_{\odot} = -4.5 \).
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex implies \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Si}}/n_{\text{Fe}})_1 - \log_{10}(n_{\text{Si}}/n_{\text{Fe}})_{\odot} = 0.3 \).
   - Substituting \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Si}}/n_{\text{Fe}})_{\odot} = \log_{10}(n_{\text{Si}}/n_{\text{H}})_{\odot} - \log_{10}(n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}})_{\odot} \), we find \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Si}}/n_{\text{H}})_1 = \log_{10}(n_{\text{Si}}/n_{\text{H}})_{\odot} + 0.3 \), thus [Si/H]_1 = 0.3.

2. **For Star_2:**
   - Given [Mg/H]_2 = 0, the magnesium abundance relative to hydrogen is the same as the Sun: \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}})_2 = \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}})_{\odot} = -5 \).
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex implies \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{Si}})_2 - \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{Si}})_{\odot} = 0.3 \).
   - Substituting \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{Si}})_{\odot} = \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}})_{\odot} - \log_{10}(n_{\text{Si}}/n_{\text{H}})_{\odot} \), we find \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Si}}/n_{\text{H}})_2 = \log_{10}(n_{\text{Si}}/n_{\text{H}})_{\odot} - 0.3 \), thus [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

3. **Ratio Calculation:**
   - The ratio of silicon abundances is \( 10^{[\text{Si/H}]_1 - [\text{Si/H}]_2} = 10^{0.3 - (-0.3)} = 10^{0.6} \).

Thus, the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is \(\boxed{10^{0.6}}\).

# R1 reasoning

Okay, so I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star 1 and Star 2. Hmm, the problem gives me masses of the stars as 1.5 and 1.2 solar masses, but I don't know if the mass affects the photospheric abundances directly. Maybe the LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium) and EW (Equivalent Width) method just means we can use the given abundances without worrying about the star's mass? I'm not entirely sure, but let me note that the masses are maybe a red herring here. Let me check the rest of the information given.

First, the elemental abundances. The notation [A/B]_star is the logarithmic ratio of the abundance of element A to element B in the star relative to the Sun. The formula for [A/B] is log10(nA/nB)_star - log10(nA/nB)_sun. Similarly, [Fe/H] would be log10(nFe/nH)_star - log10(nFe/nH)_sun.

We have for Star_1: [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex and [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex.

For Star_2: [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex and [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex.

We also have the solar photospheric composition: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 so log10(nFe/nH)_sun = 7.5 - 12 = -4.5. Similarly, for Mg: 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 implies log10(nMg/nH)_sun = 7 - 12 = -5.

Wait, let me confirm that. The standard notation is 12 + log10(nX/nH) for solar abundances. So subtracting 12 gives the log of the number density ratio. So indeed, for Fe in the sun, log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 - 12 = -4.5, so nFe/nH for the Sun is 10^{-4.5}. Similarly, Mg is log(nMg/nH) = 7 - 12 = -5, so nMg/nH_sun = 10^{-5}.

Now, for Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex, which means log10(nFe/nH)_1 - log10(nFe/nH)_sun = 0. Therefore, log10(nFe/nH)_1 = log10(nFe/nH)_sun = -4.5. So nFe/nH for Star 1 is the same as the sun, 10^{-4.5}.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex. This means log10(nSi/nFe)_1 - log10(nSi/nFe)_sun = 0.3. Let me get the solar value for [Si/Fe]. Wait, we need the solar ratios.

Wait, maybe we need to express the solar ratios of Si/Fe and Mg/Si?

Wait, the solar values given are nFe/nH and nMg/nH. To get nSi/nFe in the Sun, we need to know nSi/nH in the Sun. But they didn't tell us the solar Si abundance. Wait, oh. Wait, maybe we can figure out that we need Si abundance from Star_1 or Star_2?

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that only the given abundances are necessary. Let me parse the problem again.

The question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, Si_1 / Si_2. To find that, we need [Si/H] for both stars and then compute Si_1/Si_2 = 10^{[Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2}.

But we're given [Si/Fe]_1 and [Fe/H]_1 for Star 1, which can give us [Si/H]_1. And for Star 2, we have [Mg/Si]_2 and [Mg/H]_2, which can give us [Si/H]_2.

Let me check this logic.

Starting with Star_1:

We have [Fe/H]_1 = 0. So [Fe/H] = log(nFe/nH)_1 - log(nFe/nH)sun = 0. So log(nFe/nH)_1 = log(nFe/nHsun) = -4.5. Therefore, nFe/nH for Star 1 is 10^{-4.5}.

Then, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. The [Si/Fe] is log(nSi/nFe)_1 - log(nSi/nFe)sun = 0.3.

But to compute this, we need the solar ratio of Si/Fe.

Wait, but the problem didn't give us the solar Si abundance. Hmm. Wait, that's a problem. Because without knowing solar Si abundance, how can we find [Si/Fe] for the star?

Wait, the Sun's [Si/Fe] is by definition 0, isn't it? Since [Si/Fe] is measured relative to the Sun, assuming the Sun's ratio as the reference.

Wait, no. Wait, no. Wait, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 means that log10(nSi/nFe)_1 - log10(nSi/nFe)sun = 0.3.

Which means log10(nSi/nFe)_1 = log10(nSi/nFe)sun + 0.3.

Therefore, nSi/nFe for Star1 is (nSi/nFe)sun * 10^{0.3}.

But if we can find nSi/nFe in the Sun, then we can find it for Star1, but we don't have a value for nSi/nH in the Sun. The given solar abundances are only for Fe and Mg.

Wait, so maybe something is missing here. The problem gives the Sun's Fe and Mg abundances but not Si. Wait, maybe it's supposed to be derived from the definition of [Si/Fe]?

Wait, but if the problem states the photospheric composition of the Sun... except for Si. So maybe the problem is designed in such a way that the solar Si abundance cancels out when taking the ratio of Si_1 / Si_2.

Wait, let's try to proceed.

If Star_1: [Fe/H]_1 = 0. So nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun = 10^{-4.5}. Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. Then, log(nSi_1/nFe_1) = log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) + 0.3.

Exponentiating both sides: nSi_1 / nFe_1 = (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) * 10^{0.3}

Therefore, nSi_1 = nFe_1 * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) * 10^{0.3}

But since nFe_1 = nFe_sun (since [Fe/H]_1 = 0), then nFe_1 = 10^{-4.5} * nH_1 ?

Wait no, wait, unless we characterize nH as well. Wait, this might require assuming that nH is unity in the sense that H is the dominant element.

Alternatively, in these abundances, [Fe/H] is the log ratio of Fe abundance relative to H. For the Sun, 12 + log(nFe/nH) = 7.5, so log(nFe/nH)_sun = -4.5.

Similarly, for Star_1, [Fe/H] = 0 so log(nFe/nH)_1 = log(nFe/nH)sun = -4.5.

Therefore, nFe_1 / nH_1 = 10^{-4.5}, same as the Sun. Similarly, for Mg, nMg_2 / nH_2 = 10^{-5} (since [Mg/H]_2 = 0), because solar was given as 12 + log(nMg/nH) = 7.

Now, for Star_1: [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3.

This term is log(nSi/nFe)_1 - log(nSi/nFe)sun = 0.3. So exponentiating:

(nSi/nFe)_1 = (nSi/nFe)sun * 10^{0.3}

But in the solar case, (nSi/nFe)sun = (nSi/nH)sun / (nFe/nH)sun.

Wait yes, because (nSi/nFe) = (nSi/nH) / (nFe/nH).

So (nSi/nFe)sun = (nSi/nHsun) / (nFe/nHsun) = (nSi/nH)sun / (nFe/nH)sun.

But we know (nFe/nH)sun = 10^{-4.5}, but we don't know (nSi/nH)sun. Wait, unless I misread the problem... is [Si/H] available? Wait, no, the given solar abundances are only for Fe and Mg.

Hm, that's a problem. It seems like we need the solar abundance of Si to calculate the ratio for Star 1. But the problem hasn't given that. Maybe another approach?

Wait, let's try to express nSi in each star in terms of (nSi/nH)...

Similarly, since [X/H] is log(nX/nH)_star - log(nX/nH)_sun.

If we can express [Si/H] for each star.

For Star_1:

We need [Si/H]_1. Let's break it down. [Si/H] = log(nSi/nH) - log(nSi/nH)sun. So, knowing that, but we don't have log(nSi/nH)sun.

But maybe using Star_1: [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. So, log(nSi/nFe) - log(nSi/nFe)sun = 0.3.

Then, log(nSi/nFe) = log(nSi/nFe)sun + 0.3. 

But log(nSi/nFe) = log(nSi/nH) - log(nFe/nH), so:

log(nSi/nH)_1 - log(nFe/nH)_1 = [log(nSi/nH)sun - log(nFe/nH)sun] + 0.3

But [Fe/H]_1=0 implies log(nFe/nH)_1 = log(nFe/nH)sun.

Therefore, the equation becomes:

log(nSi/nH)_1 - log(nFe/nH)sun = log(nSi/nH)sun - log(nFe/nH)sun + 0.3

Subtracting log(nFe/nH)sun from both sides:

log(nSi/nH)_1 = log(nSi/nH)sun + 0.3

Therefore, [Si/H]_1 = 0.3 dex

Therefore, nSi/nH for Star1 is 10^{0.3} * (nSi/nH)sun.

Similarly, for Star2: We need [Si/H]_2.

Given: Star2 has [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 and [Mg/H]_2 = 0.

Let's break that down. [Mg/Si]_2 = log(nMg/nSi)_2 - log(nMg/nSi)sun =0.3.

Then, log(nMg/nSi)_2 = log(nMg/nSi)sun + 0.3.

As before, rewrite:

log(nMg/nH)_2 - log(nSi/nH)_2 = log(nMg/nH)sun - log(nSi/nH)sun + 0.3

But [Mg/H]_2=0 implies log(nMg/nH)_2 = log(nMg/nH)sun = -5 (from the Sun's value given earlier: 12 + log(nMg/nH)sun=7, so log(nMg/nH)=7-12=-5). Therefore, we have:

log(nMg/nH)sun - log(nSi/nH)_2 = log(nMg/nH)sun - log(nSi/nH)sun + 0.3

Therefore, subtract log(nMg/nH)sun from both sides:

- log(nSi/nH)_2 = - log(nSi/nH)sun + 0.3

Multiply both sides by -1:

log(nSi/nH)_2 = log(nSi/nH)sun - 0.3

Therefore, [Si/H]_2 = log(nSi/nH)_2 - log(nSi/nH)sun = -0.3 dex.

Therefore, nSi/nH for Star2 is 10^{-0.3} * (nSi/nH)sun.

Thus, the nSi/nH ratio for Star1 is 10^{0.3} * solar and that for Star2 is 10^{-0.3} * solar. Therefore, the ratio (nSi_1 / nH_1) / (nSi_2 / nH_2) = (10^{0.3} / 10^{-0.3}}) = 10^{0.6} ≈ 3.98.

But wait, the question says "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2." So presumably, if the question is just nSi1 / nSi2? But that ratio would depend on their hydrogen abundances as well. Unless they're asking for nSi/nH for each star and then ratio the nSi/nH, but the way the question is phrased, "ratio of silicon atoms," suggests the actual number densities. But if the hydrogen abundances differ between the two stars, then the answer is 10^{0.6} multiplied by (nH1 / nH2).

But do we know nH for each star? If we assume that [Fe/H]_1 = 0 would mean that the metallicity (Fe abundance relative to H) is the same as the Sun, but to get H abundance, however, H is the main component, so perhaps we can assume that the number density of H is approximately the same for both stars? But that might not be valid. Wait, how is H calculated here?

Wait, the star's overall metal content affects the H abundance. For instance, ([Fe/H] = 0 means that Fe/H is the same as the sun, but the star's H abundance (in number density terms) would be depending on their overall composition. Wait, for the Sun, values are all normalized so that H is 12 + log(nH/nH) = 12, but that's just by definition. Actually, no, I'm confused. Wait, nH for the Sun is such that 12 + log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 defines the Fe abundance as 7.5. But how do we get actual number densities?

Alternatively, maybe when dealing with ratios, the H terms will cancel, but no.

Wait, in Star_1: nSi1/nH1 = 10^{0.3} * nSiSun/nHSun

Star_2: nSi2/nH2 = 10^{-0.3} * nSiSun/nHSun

Thus, the ratio (nSi1/nH1)/(nSi2/nH2) = 10^{0.6}

But the problem asks for nSi1 / nSi2. To find this, multiply the ratio (nSi1/nH1) / (nSi2/nH2) by (nH1 / nH2).

Therefore, (nSi1 / nSi2) = (nSi1/nH1) / (nSi2/nH2) * (nH1 / nH2) = 10^{0.6} * (nH1 / nH2)

But we don't know (nH1 / nH2) here. How can we compute that?

Wait maybe the hydrogen abundances are the same for both stars? But that can't be assumed. Wait, perhaps [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] are 0, but in reality, the hydrogen abundance must adjust to accommodate the changes in metallicity.

Alternatively, let's think that hydrogen is the main component for both stars. So the number density of H is approximately 1 in the Sun? Let me see. Oh, in astrophysics, it's common to use the logarithmic abundance scale where 12 + log10(nX/nH) gives the abundance of element X. The solar composition has hydrogen as the most abundant element, so log10(nH/nH) = 0, and 12 + log10(nH/nH) =12, but how that relates into actual densities.

Alternatively, perhaps nH here is considered to be the same for all stars? But in reality, stars can have different hydrogen abundances depending on metallicity. A star with [Fe/H] = 0 would have the same Fe/H as the Sun, but if the overall metallicity is different, then the H abundance may adjust. However, since Fe and Mg abundances for the stars are given as the same as the Sun's (Star1: [Fe/H]=0, Star2: [Mg/H]=0), but then in Star1's case, perhaps the Mg abundance could differ?

Wait, but for the star with [Fe/H] = 0, all other elements would have patterns, but unless there are other abundance ratios given, it's complicated.

But maybe another approach: For Star_1, [Fe/H] = 0. So number abundance for Fe, nFe = nFe_sun. Hydrogen abundance is same as the sun? Not necessarily, because [Fe/H] is log(nFe/nH) which is fixed. So nFe/nH = same as solar => more Fe implies less H? Not necessarily. Wait: Actually, if a star has 1.5 times the mass of the Sun, does that affect the photospheric composition? I thought LTE is assumed here, so we can ignore processes like gravitational settling, and Stellar_1 is higher mass, but maybe with the same metallicity.

But the problem states that [Fe/H]_1 = 0. So [Fe/H]_1 = log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe/nH)sun = 0, which implies that log(nFe/nH) = log(nFe/nH)sun = -4.5. Which equates to nFe/nH = 10^{-4.5} regardless of the star's other properties. Similarly, [Mg/H]_2 = 0 => nM2/nH2 = 10^{-5} (the same as the solar Mg abundance). So in Star 1, Fe/H=solar; Star 2, Mg/H=solar.

But how do these relate to the hydrogen content?

Wait, perhaps we can consider that for stars with different heavy element abundances, the hydrogen abundance (nH) adjusts. If Star 1 has same Fe/H as Sun, and Star 2 same Mg/H as Sun. If the ratio of nH1 and nH2? Let me attempt.

Let's assume that both stars have the same total mass, but their metallicity affects their H abundance. But since their masses given are different (1.5 and 1.2) solar, but perhaps we don't need to connect mass here?

Alternatively, when changing [X/H], does that affect the number of H atoms? For instance, [Fe/H] = 0 would mean Fe is the same fraction relative to H as the sun. H is the dominant component. So, if Fe/H is the same, but the alpha elements (like Si) are different, but H is such that Fe/H remains same. Wait, so nH1 is the same as solar for Star1?

But not, if Star1 has higher metallicity, but since [Fe/H] is same, meaning their Fe abundance relative to H is solar. Similarly, if there's an enhancement in Si relative to Fe by 0.3 dex in Star1, then Si/H would be higher.

Wait, perhaps we can ignore nH as being the same? Because for extremely metal-poor stars, nH would be similar as the sun. but in this case.

Alternatively, perhaps because H is the majority, the difference in metal abundances accounts for such a minimal effect that we can approximate nH1 ≈ nH2. But is that justified?

Wait, no. Let me see. For the sun, the metals (elements heavier than He) are only about ~1-2% by mass. Hence, even if a star has double the metallicity, the change in H would be minimal (maybe 98% vs 99% H by mass). However, since the number density depends on the number of atoms, and H is much lighter. Oh solar abundances.

But in terms of number density, hydrogen is about 90% of atoms, helium about 10%, so metals are about <1%. So, the metallicity in dex terms is a logarithmic measure. So for small changes in metallicity ([X/H] ~ 0.3), the actual number density of H is not affected much, so perhaps we can assume that nH is same for both stars?

Alternatively, if the problem doesn't mention anything about it, maybe requires that. Therefore, if we can approximate nH1 ≈ nH2, then the ratio nSi1 / nSi2 would be equal to (nSi/nH1) / (nSi/nH2) : which is 10^{0.6} times solar/solar? Wait, we defined above:

For Star1: nSi1/nH1 = 10^{0.3} * (nSi/sun)/nHSun

For Star2: nSi2/nH2 = 10^{-0.3} * (nSi/sun)/nHSun

If nH1 = nH2 = nHSun, this would mean nSi1/nSi2 = 10^{0.3}/10^{-0.3} = 10^{0.6}. So then the answer would be 10^0.6 , which is approx 3.98.

But given that the actual ratio nSi1/nH is 10^{0.3} * (nSi/Sun/nH/Sun), and nSi2/nH is 10^{-0.3}*(nSi/Sun/nH/Sun).

Therefore, if nH1 and nH2 are equal, then could do so. But given that Star1 has higher metallicity, but maybe no. Let me think.

But Star2 has [Mg/H] =0, so the same Mg vs H as the Sun, but Star1 has [Si/Fe] = 0.3, which would make [Si/H]_1 =0.3, but nSi1/nH1 is 10^{0.3}*(nSi/Sun/nH/Sun), and nH1 for Star_1 would be the hydrogen number density such that nFe1 /nH1 = Solar. If Star1 has higher Si, but same Fe, would that require nH1 lower?

Wait, but keeping iron same means that nFe1/nH1 = solar value. If overall metallicity is higher (since Si is 0.3 dex higher, we need to adjust He and/or H). But given that He abundance isn't specified, it's getting too complex.

Given that the problem is posed as a homework problem, and given the information, perhaps we are supposed to ignore the hydrogen number densities differences and assume nH1 =nH2 =nH_sun. Probably because photospheric abundances are normalized via [X/H], which is relative to the solar H. Unless told the H has changed, we can take [X/H] = log(nX/nH)_star - log(nX/nH)sun =0 would mean log(nX/nH)_star is same as solar, which might implicitly take H that whether it's same or not. However, unless an element's [X/H] is modified, it's H that you could take as assumption like that. But since in Star1, we have [Fe/H]=0, so Fe/H same as sun. In Star2, [Mg/H]=0, same as sun.

But Star1 might have altered H due to the overall metallicity changes. For example, If Star1 actually have enhanced Si compared to the sun (at same Fe/H), that would mean slightly larger metal content. So compared to sun, nSi is larger, other metals same??? Some of unknowns here.

But perhaps for the purpose of this problem, the expected approach is:

Compute nSi1, nSi2, recognized that in each star, using their observed abundances, solve under the implicit assumption that [X/H] are known and stars might differ in overall metallicity but H is normalized accordingly. But perhaps max like:

The abundance ratios can be determined using the given [Si/Fe] and [Fe/H], and cultivating other values accordingly.

Thus:

Star1: [Fe/H]_1 = 0 => as sun's Fe/H: nFe1/nH1 = 1 sun's (Fe/H).

And [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3. which as per previous computation gives [Si/H]_1 =0.3. Mustn't this imply nSi1/nH1 = 10^{0.3} *  n_Si/Sun / nH/Sun ?

But how much is that, and Star2.

Star2: [Mg/H]_2 =0 => Mg/H same as sun. And [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3.

That implies [Si/H]_2 = [Mg/H] - [Mg/Si] =0 - 0.3 ?

Wait wait. Let me explain this.

In Star2: [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 = log(nMg_2/nSi_2) - log(nMg/Sun/nSi/Sun)

Let me rearrange:

log(nMg_2/nSi_2) = log(nMg/Sun/nSi/Sun) + 0.3

Then, log(nSi_2/nH_2) = log(nMg_2/nH_2) - [ log(nMg/Sun/nSi/Sun) +0.3 ]

But [Mg/H]_2=0 => log(nMg_2/nH_2) = log(nMg/Sun/nH/Sun) = (12 + log(nMg/Sun/nH/Sun))?

Wait, No. No. Let me track the definition:

For any element X:

[X/H] = log(nX/nH) - log(nXSun/nHSun )

So if [X/H] is zero, then log(nX/nH) = log(nXSun/nHSu )

Thus, for Star 2: [Mg/H]_2 =0 implies log(nMg/nH)_2 = log(nMg/Sun/nHSun )

And nMg_2/nH_2 = nMg/Sun / nHSun.

Similarly, given also [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3.

[Mg/Si] = log(nMg/nSi) - log(nMg/Sun /nSi/Sun) =0.3. Rearranged,

log(nMg/(nSi))_2 = log(nMgSun/nSiSun) +0.3

Taking the antilog,

nMg_2 / nSi_2 = (nMgSun/nSiSun) *10^{0.3}

Similarly, nSi_2 /nMg_2 = (nSiSun/nMgSun ) *10^{-0.3}

But nMg_2 = nMgSun /nHSun * nH_2, from previous [Mg/H]_2=0.

Wait, nMg_2 = (nMgSun / nHSun)*nH_2.

Thus, substituting into previous equation,

nSi_2 = (nMg_2 * nSiSun / nMgSun ) *10^{-0.3}

= [ (nMgSun /nHSun * nH_2 ) * nSiSun /nMgSun ] *10^{-0.3}

Simplify:

nSi_2 = (nH_2 *nSiSun /nHSun ) *10^{-0.3}

So,

nSi_2/nH_2 = (nSiSun /nHSun )*10^{-0.3}

Thus, [Si/H]_2 = log(nSi/nH)_2 - log(nSi/Sun/nH/Sun )

= log(10^{-0.3} * (nSi/Sun/nH/Sun )) - log(nSi/Sun/nH/Sun )

= -0.3.

Hence confirming our prior calculation that [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

Similarly for Star1, [Si/H]_1 =0.3. So, log(nSi/nH )_1 - log(nSi/Sun/nH/Sun )=0.3, so nSi_1/nH_1 = (nSi/Sun/nH/Sun ) *10^{0.3}

So if we want the ratio nSi1 /nSi2,

We have:

nSi1 /nH1 = A*10^{0.3}

nSi2 /nH2 = A*10^{-0.3}

Where A= nSi/Sun/nH/Sun

Therefore, nSi1= nH1 * A *10^{0.3}

nSi2= nH2 * A*10^{-0.3}

Therefore, ratio nSi1/nSi2= (nH1 /nH2)*10^{0.6}

But perhaps implicitly in this notation, but given the ambiguity of hydrogen abundance, but unless we neglect the H term, this ratio would be 10^{0.6}. But is this even justified?

Wait, if Star1 and Star2 have different hydrogen abundances, but given that [Fe/H] in Star1 is solar and [Mg/H] in Star2 is solar and no information on other elements.

So the problem is whether it's appropriate to assume nH1 = nH2.

Alternatively, think in terms of:

Ratio Si_1/Si_2= (nSi1/nH1)/(nSi2/nH2) * (nH1/nH2). As before.

If only given that Star1 [Fe/H]=0 and Star2 [Mg/H]=0.

But in Star1:

give all abundances should be calculated assuming Sun's mixing ratio. But the problem is, how doe lenses compare hydrogen.

Luckily, both nH1 and nH2 can be tied to spectator elements.

But for Star1, [Fe/H] =0 implies that nFe1/nH1 =nFe/Sun/nH/Sun, so nH1= nFe1/(nFe/Sun/n/H Sun) = (nFe1/nFeSun) * nH/Sun

If we assume that photospheric abundances are scaled solar and that other elements not specified are scaled similarly. Wait, but for Star1, [Si/Fe]=0.3 implies that Si is enhanced, but [Fe/H]=0, so if metals are of solar apart from Si? Not sure. Alternatively, for Star_1, since only [Si/Fe] is given as enhanced, but [Fe/H]=0, need to relate.

Alternatively, we can state that relative to the Sun, for Star1: log(nSi/nFe)=0.3, thus. So ne (Si)=ne (Fe)*10^{0.3}. With [Fe/H]=0. So the number density of Fe is same ratio to H as Sun. Thus, nFe1= nFe/Sun * (nH1/nH/Sun).

Hmm.

Uğ, I think if you have some more patience.

The key issue is to find the ratio (nSi_1 / nSi_2). Considering that in Star1:

nSi_1 = nH1 * (nSi/nH)_1,

Likewise for Star2:

nSi2 = nH2 * (nSi/nH)_2.

The problem is thus, without knowledge of relative H densities, can we connect nH1 and nH2?

But if Star1's composition scales with solar except for [Si/Fe]=0.3 and Star2's composition scales with solar except for [Mg/Si]=0.3. Unless other elements are same as Sun. Therefore, if calculating metallicity proportional - but even so, H is such that the total is one.

But unless there's additional info, and given that procedures handle [X/H] values, and 1Star's Fe / H and Star2's Mg/H are same as solar. Since both have [X/H]=0 for one.

Alternatively, take the ratio to be (nSi1 / nH1) / (nSi2 / nH2) =10^{0.6} while:

(nSi1 / nSi2 )= (10^{0.6}) * (nH1 /nH2}

But if we asusme that nH1 /nH2 =1, as no information, then answer is 10^{0.6}.

But we need to justify that, but perhaps.

Given that both stars have solar [X/H] for at least one element, then assuming nH reflects that if other elements aren't mentioned. For example, [Fe/H]=0 in Star1 implies that the metallicity is the same Sun, so in the absence of other enrichments, nH is same.However, Si is enhanced.

Similarly, Star2 has [Mg/H]=0, meaning that metallicity in Mg is the same. But Si is decreased, so total metallicity might just follow silicate momger. But overall, if we don't have information on how other elements are, how can we relate their nH?

Alternatively, perhaps both of the stars have normal. H abundances? Probably., given the problem only modifies certain .

But given that the problem lists [Fe/H]_1=0 → same as sun, so more specifically, in a star that is “like the sun” in FeHs, but with an overabundance of Si relative to Fe. Therefore, assuming Si is enhanced, which would mean giving up some  previous Solar kind

TL;DR: The problem is likely designed so that nH1 =nH2≈nH_sun. If we make that assumption, then [Si/H]_1 =0.3 , [Si/H]_2=-0.3. So the ratio nSi1/nSi2 is 10^{0.3 - (-0.3)}=10^{0.6}≈3.98.

But justifications for why we ignore precautions.

Given the lack of any other information, perhaps this is the solution we should reach.

So, final Ratio of Silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2 is 10^(0.6) ≈ 3.98 ≈4. But 10^0.6 is exactly(10^(3/5)= (10^(1/5))^3 ≈1.778^3≈5.62)??

Wait no, Wait, log10(10^{0.6}) is 0.6 : 10^0.6.

Actually calculator value:

10^(0.6) = e^{ln(10)*0.6} ) ≈ e^{2.302585093*0.6}=e^{1.381551}=3.981 ≈3.98.

Wait OK.

So the final answer is approximately 10^0.6 ≈3.98.

Assuming the problem wants it written as 10^(0.6). Eitherway, but close.

Alternatively, should we calculate it precisely?

But since 0.3 dex is the increment:

Star1: [Si/H]_1 = +0.3,

Star2: [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

So log(nSi1/nH1) - log(nSiSun/nHSun)=0.3 → log(nSi1/nH1) = 0.3 + log(nSiSun/nHSun).

Similarly for Star2: of course，除却不H2的differences，logn≈ and 0.6.

Hence, the ratio (nSi1 /nSi2) in different stars＝10^(0.6)≈3.98.

Thus, the answer is 10^{0.6} ≈ 3.98, which can be approximated to two significant figures, but given the input data are to 0.1 dex (0.3, etc. typically have one decimal), so perhaps \boxed{10^{0.6}} or \boxed{3.98} are plausible, but sometimes such problems expect the exact exponential form.

Alternatively, conversion if necessary：

But 10^{0.6} = 10^{0.5}*10^{0.1} ≈3.162*1.259 ≈ 3.98, so approximately 4.0. Perhaps.

But the question didn't specify how to present it. Probably wants the exact value in exponential terms.

Wait但在天文学中通常会写成数值形式，如果没有说明，可能是下划线的bOxED里填比较准确的数值或者指数形式。

So according to EWs, I think boxed 10^{0.6} 或直接计算给出数值约3.98.

But likely as 10^{0.6}.

Alternatively, confirm the answer.

Alternatively, after much calculation, leaving it as:

nSi1/nSi2=10^( [Si/H]_1 -[Si/H]_2 )=10^{0.3 - (-0.3)}=10^{0.6}, which is approximately 3.98, since [Si/H] difference is 0.6.

Thus, the answer is 10^0.6 or approximately 4.0. So based on the precise calculation, I might go with 10^{0.6}.

Hence, theanswer should be \boxed{10^{0.6}}.
