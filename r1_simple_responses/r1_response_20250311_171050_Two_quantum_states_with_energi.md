To distinguish two quantum states with energies \(E_1\) and \(E_2\) with lifetimes \(10^{-9}\) seconds and \(10^{-8}\) seconds respectively, we need to consider the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The uncertainty in energy (ΔE) is related to the lifetime (τ) by the equation:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{\hbar}{\tau}
\]

where \(\hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s}\).

For the first state with lifetime \(10^{-9}\) seconds:
\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s}}{10^{-9} \, \text{s}} = 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
\]

For the second state with lifetime \(10^{-8}\) seconds:
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s}}{10^{-8} \, \text{s}} = 6.582 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}
\]

The total linewidth (Γ_total) is the sum of the uncertainties:
\[
\Gamma_{\text{total}} = \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 = 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} + 6.582 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} = 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
\]

To clearly resolve the two energy levels, their energy difference must be larger than this total linewidth. The smallest value greater than \(7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}\) is \(10^{-6} \, \text{eV}\).

\[
\boxed{10^{-6} \, \text{eV}}
\]

# R1 reasoning

Alright, so I have this problem here about distinguishing two quantum states based on their energies and lifetimes. Let me try to unpack what it's asking. The question says that two quantum states have energies E1 and E2, with lifetimes of 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds respectively. We need to figure out which energy difference would allow us to clearly resolve these two energy levels. The options aren't listed here, but I guess the idea is to think through the principles involved and determine what range the energy difference should be in.

First, I remember from the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle that there's a relationship between the lifetime of a state and the uncertainty in its energy. The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is on the order of ħ/2. So, ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. Wait, no, actually, more accurately, the uncertainty principle says ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2. That’s the Heisenberg inequality for energy and time.

So, the lifetime of the state is related to the uncertainty in the energy. A shorter lifetime means a larger uncertainty in energy. For each energy level, the energy isn't perfectly defined because of their finite lifetimes. The natural linewidth of a spectral line is related to this uncertainty. To resolve two energy levels, their energy difference should be larger than the combined uncertainty from both levels. Otherwise, the lines would overlap too much, and we couldn't tell them apart.

Let me formalize this a bit. For each state, the uncertainty in energy is given by ΔE1 = ħ / (2Δt1) and ΔE2 = ħ / (2Δt2), where Δt1 and Δt2 are the lifetimes of the states. Here, Δt1 is 10^-9 seconds and Δt2 is 10^-8 seconds. Plugging those in, we can calculate the energy uncertainties for each state.

So first, let's compute ħ. ħ is the reduced Planck constant, which is approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s. But sometimes in these problems, people use eV·s units. Wait, maybe I should convert ħ into eV·s to make the energies come out in electron volts, which is more common for energy levels in atoms or particles.

1 eV is 1.602 × 10^-19 J. So, ħ in eV·s would be 1.0545718e-34 J·s / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 6.582 × 10^-16 eV·s.

Alright, so ΔE1 = (6.582e-16 eV·s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) = 6.582e-16 / 2e-9 = 3.291e-7 eV.

Similarly, ΔE2 = 6.582e-16 / (2 * 1e-8) = 6.582e-16 / 2e-8 = 3.291e-8 eV.

So the energy uncertainties due to their lifetimes are roughly 3.29e-7 eV and 3.29e-8 eV for E1 and E2, respectively.

But when considering whether two spectral lines can be resolved, the total linewidth is a combination of both. Or maybe it's the sum of their uncertainties. Wait, I need to recall how line broadening works.

If the two energy levels have independent uncertainties, then the total uncertainty when you transition between them would be something like the convolution of their line shapes. But if we model each line as a Lorentzian (which comes from the exponential decay in time), then the full width at half maximum (FWHM) for each is Γ1 = ħ / τ1 and Γ2 = ħ / τ2. The total linewidth when two transitions are involved might be Γ1 + Γ2? I think that's the case. Because each energy level contributes to the broadening. So, when you have a transition from a state with lifetime τ1 to a state with lifetime τ2, the total FWHM would be Γ1 + Γ2. 

Wait, let me make sure. For spontaneous emission, the natural linewidth is determined by the sum of the inverse lifetimes of the upper and lower states. Wait, no, perhaps. Let me check.

No, actually, if you have an excited state with lifetime τ (so the upper state has a certain linewidth), and the lower state is a ground state with a very long lifetime (so negligible linewidth), then the FWHM is just Γ = ħ / τ. But if both the upper and lower states have finite lifetimes, then the total linewidth would be Γ_upper + Γ_lower. Because each contributes their own uncertainty. So yes, I think that is correct.

Therefore, in this problem, since both states have finite lifetimes, we need to add their individual linewidths. Therefore, the total FWHM would be Γ1 + Γ2 = ħ / τ1 + ħ / τ2.

So, computing that in eV:

Γ1 = 6.582e-16 eV·s / (1e-9 s) = 6.582e-7 eV

Γ2 = 6.582e-16 / 1e-8 = 6.582e-8 eV

Therefore, the total linewidth Γ = Γ1 + Γ2 = 6.582e-7 + 6.582e-8 = 7.2402e-7 eV ≈ 7.24e-7 eV.

To resolve two spectral lines, the energy difference between them should be greater than this linewidth. According to the Rayleigh criterion, two peaks are considered resolvable when their separation is at least equal to their linewidth. But I need to confirm whether the Rayleigh criterion applies here or if it's a different criterion. The Rayleigh criterion is for diffraction-limited imaging, stating that two point sources are resolvable when the principal maximum of one coincides with the first minimum of the other. For spectral lines with Lorentzian profiles (which have wider tails than Gaussian), the resolution criterion might require a larger separation.

Wait, but spectral lines in quantum mechanics are often modeled as Lorentzians, which don't have the same kind of minima as Airy disks from diffraction. The linewidth for Lorentzians is typically defined as FWHM. If the two Lorentzians are separated by more than their FWHM, maybe they can be resolved. Alternatively, maybe they should be separated by more than the sum of their FWHM. But each of the two energy levels' linewidths are Γ1 and Γ2, so the total linewidth when transitioning between them is Γ1 + Γ2. Then, the energy separation should be greater than this combined linewidth.

Thus, the energy difference ΔE = |E2 - E1| should be greater than Γ1 + Γ2 ≈ 7.24e-7 eV.

So the question is asking which option could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved. From the calculated Γ1 + Γ2 ≈ 7.24e-7 eV, the energy difference needs to be larger than this value.

Looking at possible options (assuming the choices are given in eV), the correct answer should be greater than approximately 7.24e-7 eV.

But let me check that we're computing the uncertainties correctly.

According to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, ΔE = ħ / (2τ). Wait, actually, it's ΔE * τ ≈ ħ/2 for the Gaussian wavepacket case, but for exponential decay (which gives Lorentzian line shape), the FWHM is Γ = ħ / τ. So depending on the coefficient, how exact do I need to be here?

Let me check, for an exponentially decaying state with lifetime τ (mean lifetime), the energy uncertainty is given by Γ = ħ / τ, which is the FWHM of the Lorentzian. So in this case, Γ = ħ / τ, not ħ/(2τ). Because I think in the Fourier transform of an exponential decay exp(-t/(2τ)), the FWHM of the spectral line is Γ = ħ / τ. Wait, the exact derivation comes from the Fourier transform of the time-dependent part of the wavefunction. The probability amplitude for the state decays as exp(-t/(2τ)) (assuming τ is the lifetime), so the Fourier transform is a Lorentzian with FWHM Γ = ħ/τ. So, in that case, Γ is called the natural linewidth.

Yes, that seems familiar. Hence, the proper expression here is Γ = ħ / τ. So each energy level contributes Γ_i = ħ / τ_i, and the total linewidth when transitioning between the two would be Γ1 + Γ2.

Therefore, the uncertainties add, hence Γ_total = Γ1 + Γ2 = ħ (1/τ1 + 1/τ2).

Given τ1 = 1e-9 s and τ2 = 1e-8 s,

Γ1 = 6.582e-16 eV·s / 1e-9 s = 6.582e-7 eV

Γ2 = 6.582e-16 eV·s / 1e-8 s = 6.582e-8 eV

Γ_total = 6.582e-7 + 6.582e-8 = 7.24e-7 eV ≈ 0.724 μeV.

Therefore, to clearly resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be greater than approximately 0.724 μeV (since their linewidths would contribute a total spread of that amount). Therefore, the energy difference needs to be larger than this value to have distinct peaks.

Given possible options, I would choose the smallest energy difference larger than ~0.7 μeV. But since the answer options are not provided here, perhaps the standard approach is to go with the calculated minimum energy difference needed. If this value is about 7.2e-7 eV, then check the options given.

Assuming the options are multiple-choice with possible values, but since they aren't listed, maybe I have to recall common energy scales. Or perhaps use order of magnitude estimation.

Alternatively, perhaps an energy difference of 10^-6 eV (1 μeV) would be sufficient. But wait, 1 μeV is 1e-6 eV, which is larger than 7.24e-7 eV (which is 0.724 μeV). So 1 μeV would work. If an option is 10^-6 eV, that would be sufficient. Alternatively, if one of them is 10^-7 eV, which is smaller, so you couldn't resolve. Alternatively, 10^-9 eV (smaller still), and so on.

Therefore, the key idea is that the energy difference should be larger than the sum of the linewidths, which in this case is approximately 7.24e-7 eV. So if the options are, for example: a)1e-6 eV, b)1e-7 eV, c)1e-8 eV, d)1e-9 eV, then a)1e-6 eV would be the answer.

But the problem asks: "Which one of the following options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?" So probably, among the choices given, the correct one is greater than approximately 0.7 μeV, so perhaps 1 μeV. But since the user didn't provide the options, maybe it's expecting to calculate the minimum required energy difference as ~1e-6 eV.

Alternatively, if there is an option of 1e-6 eV (which is 1 μeV), that should be acceptable.

Wait, but perhaps instead of the FWHM, there's another consideration for the resolution. Rayleigh criterion in terms of peaks says that the separation should be at least the FWHM so that the combined intensity dip is about 20% between the two peaks. So with the separation equal to FWHM, you can just resolve them. So, but if they are separated by more than FWHM, then it's easier. So the minimal required separation would be around the FWHM.

Hence, in this case, since the combined FWHM is ≈ 0.72 μeV, if the energy difference is larger than that, they can be resolved. So if we have a value like 1 μeV, which is around 1.4 times the FWHM, that would suffice.

Alternatively, maybe they want the energy difference to be much larger than the uncertainty, so that there's a clear distinction.

Wait, perhaps different sources may use different factors, but the general idea is that the energy separation should be greater than the sum of the linewidths. For example, some sources may state that to resolve two peaks, the energy difference should satisfy ΔE > Γ1 + Γ2, so ΔE > 7.24e-7 eV.

Given that, the answer is whatever energy from the options is just greater than that. So assuming the options are 1e-9 eV, 1e-8 eV, 1e-7 eV, 1e-6 eV, 1e-5 eV, etc., then 1e-6 eV would work.

So in that line of thought, yes, 1e-6 eV would be sufficient, since it's larger than 7.24e-7 eV. So the answer is 1e-6 eV.

Alternatively, if there's an option of 5e-7 eV, that's 0.5 μeV, which is less than 0.72 μeV, so that's not acceptable. Wait, 5e-7 would be 0.5 μeV, which is smaller than 0.72 μeV. So no.

The main issue for my answer is that. Find from the options an energy difference greater than approx 0.724 μeV.

Therefore, if the presented options include 1e-6 eV (1 μeV), that's correct. If there is an option 1e-5 eV (10 μeV), that's even better. But since I can’t see the options, probably 1e-6 eV would be the correct answer, as per the calculations.

Thus, after all this, the energy difference should be at least approximately 0.724 μeV. So the correct option is the one that’s just larger than this value.

Alternatively, if the options use the order of magnitude, they could be presented as 1e-6 eV (10^-6), which is 1 μeV, which is 1e-6.

Summary:

Energy uncertainties:

Γ1 ≈ 6.58e-7 eV

Γ2 ≈ 6.58e-8 eV

Total linewidth Γ_total ≈ 7.24e-7 eV

Therefore, the energy difference should be greater than ~7.24e-7 eV. Therefore, if the options include 10^-6 eV (which is 1e-6 eV = 1 μeV), that's greater than 7.24e-7 eV (0.724 μeV), so that would be sufficient.

Alternatively, a smarter approach could involve dimensional analysis.

Since the natural linewidth is given by Γ = ħ / τ, then the linewidth is ħ over the lifetime. For two states, the combined Γ is the sum of the individual Γ’s.

Converting 1e-9 s and 1e-8 s into energies via Γ = ħ/τ.

But another way to remember is that 1 eV·s ≈ 1.52e33, because 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s, so in eV·s, it's ~6.58e-16 eV·s. Therefore, Γ (eV) = 6.58e-16 eV·s divided by the lifetime in seconds.

So for 1e-9 s: 6.58e-16 / 1e-9 = 6.58e-7 eV

For 1e-8 s: 6.58e-16 / 1e-8 = 6.58e-8 eV

So summing both gives ~7.24e-7 eV

Which again, leads us to needing the energy difference > ~7.24e-7 eV.

Thus, converting that into different units: 7.24e-7 eV is 0.724 μeV. So, in order to resolve the states, their energy difference should be larger than approximately 0.7 microelectron volts. Therefore, an energy difference on the order of 1 μeV (which is 1e-6 eV) is sufficient. Hence, out of the typical given options, 10^-6 eV is the answer.

Given the problem states "options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved", and assuming that they list options in different orders of magnitude, 10^-6 eV is the answer.

Was there any step where I could have erred? Let me check once again.

Lifetime τ: yes, 1e-9 and 1e-8. Match with Γ = ħ / τ.

Calculations: 6.582e-16 eV·s divided by 1e-9 s: 6.582e-7 eV. Divided by 1e-8: 6.582e-8. Sum: approximately 7.24e-7. Correct.

Units conversion: All right, dealing in eV·s and seconds, correctly calculating Γ in eV. That checks out.

Summing of Γ1 and Γ2: Right, because the transition linewidth combines the uncertainties, which add (since both contributes to the total linewidth).

Resolution criterion: Separation must be greater than the combined linewidth. Yes, commonly accepted.

Therefore, confident with the conclusion.

**Final Answer**
The energy difference should be at least approximately \(7.24 \times 10^{-7}\) eV. Among the options provided, the correct choice would be \boxed{10^{-6} \, \text{eV}}.
