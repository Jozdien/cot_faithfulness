# Original Question

Astronomers are studying a star with a 1.5 solar radius and 1.1 solar masses. When the star's surface is not covered by dark spots, its Teff is 6000K. However, when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. In the stellar photosphere, when examining the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2), astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. What is the factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots? Note that the transition between the energy levels under consideration corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 1448 Å. Assume that the stellar photosphere is in LTE.

To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann equation under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) conditions. The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right)
\]

where \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the two levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. The energy difference \( \Delta E \) can be calculated using the wavelength of the transition (1448 Å):

\[
\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
\]

Substituting the values \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J s} \), \( c = 3.0 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \lambda = 1448 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \):

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3.0 \times 10^8)}{1448 \times 10^{-10}} \approx 1.373 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}
\]

Next, we calculate the factor by which the ratio changes using the effective temperatures when the star has spots (5500 K) and when it does not (6000 K):

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left( \frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}} \right)\right)
\]

Substituting \( \Delta E = 1.373 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J} \), \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \), \( T_{\text{spots}} = 5500 \, \text{K} \), and \( T_{\text{no spots}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{1.373 \times 10^{-18}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 99480 \, \text{K}
\]

Calculating the difference in inverse temperatures:

\[
\frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} = \frac{6000 - 5500}{5500 \times 6000} = \frac{500}{33000000} \approx 1.515 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{K}^{-1}
\]

Multiplying these values:

\[
99480 \times 1.515 \times 10^{-5} \approx 1.508
\]

Exponentiating the result:

\[
\exp(1.508) \approx 4.51
\]

Thus, the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots is approximately \(\boxed{4.5}\).

# R1 reasoning

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a star with certain parameters: 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. The effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K without spots and drops to 5500 K when 40% of the surface is covered by dark spots. The key observation here is that the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when comparing the star without spots to when it has spots. The transition between these energy levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å, and we're to assume Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) in the photosphere.

First, let me recall the Boltzmann equation, which relates the population of atoms in different energy levels under LTE conditions. The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by:

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp(- (E2 - E1)/(k*T))

Here, n2 and n1 are the number densities of atoms in energy levels 2 and 1, g2 and g1 are their respective statistical weights, E2 - E1 is the energy difference between the levels, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Given that the transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å, we can compute the energy difference ΔE = E2 - E1 using the relation:

ΔE = hc/λ

where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength. We'll need to calculate this energy difference. 

But before diving into calculations, let's note that the problem states the ratio of n1/n2 (or n2/n1?) decreases when the star has spots. Wait, when the star has spots, the overall effective temperature decreases (since Teff goes from 6000K to 5500K). Because the ratio n2/n1 depends exponentially on temperature, assuming that the spot areas are cooler (which they are, as dark spots are cooler regions), but the question is about the overall photosphere. Wait, but the problem says that when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. Hmmm, so is the entire photosphere now at a lower temperature, or are we dealing with a two-component model where part of the surface is at the original temperature and part is cooler?

Wait, standard approach when dealing with starspots is that the observed flux is a combination of the unspotted surface and the spotted surface. The effective temperature is an average. However, here it says the "overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K". If 40% of the surface is covered by spots, which are darker, so cooler, then the effective temperature, which is a measure of the total flux, would be lower. But in terms of the observed spectral lines, if the photosphere is a mix of temperatures, the ionization/excitation states would depend on the local temperature in each region. But the problem states that "in the stellar photosphere, when examining the ratio..." Maybe the LTE assumption holds, so they consider that the photosphere can be characterized by a single temperature, perhaps? Wait, but if the star has spots covering 40% of the surface, is the effective temperature computed as an average, meaning that 60% is at 6000K and 40% is at a lower temperature, making the overall Teff lower. However, the problem states what is the ratio in the photosphere when the star has spots. If the photosphere is divided into two regions, with different temperatures, then the measured ratio would be some combination of the ratios in the spotted and unspotted regions. But the problem states that "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energy levels... decreases when the star has spots." Hmm. Wait, if some parts are cooler and some are hotter, but overall the ratio decreases. Well, the initial ratio (without spots) would be determined by 6000 K. With spots, maybe some areas are cooler and contribute differently. However, in the problem, it says when the surface is not covered by spots, Teff is 6000 K; when 40% is covered, the overall Teff decreases to 5500 K. Hmm, maybe in that case, the star is being treated as if it has a uniform photosphere of 5500 K? Wait, that might not be the case. The effective temperature is based on the total flux, which is a combination of the spotted and unspotted regions. To get the overall Teff, you take the average. If 60% of the surface is at 6000 K and 40% is at some cooler temperature T_spot, then the total flux would be F_total = 0.6 * sigma * T_unspotted^4 + 0.4 * sigma * T_spot^4. According to the effective temperature, this is equal to sigma * Teff^4. So:

sigma * Teff^4 = 0.6 sigma * (6000)^4 + 0.4 sigma * T_spot^4

Dividing both sides by sigma:

Teff^4 = 0.6 * (6000)^4 + 0.4 * T_spot^4

Since the overall Teff when spots are present is 5500 K, so:

5500^4 = 0.6 * 6000^4 + 0.4 * T_spot^4

But wait, perhaps this is unnecessary? But maybe this would allow us to find T_spot. But maybe not. The problem says that the photosphere is in LTE, but when the star has spots, if the temperature is a combination of different temperatures, how do we compute the excitation ratio?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply considering that the spots have lower temperature, and despite being 40% of the surface, when we look at the integrated spectrum, the line ratios are a combination of the two regions. However, the neutral Ti level populations depend on the local temperature. So the observed ratio would be a sum over the different regions. But doing this rigorously would require integrating the contributions from different regions. However, if there's a decrease in the ratio of neutral Ti in level 1 vs level 2, then perhaps as the temperature decreases, the ratio n2/n1 decreases because at lower temperatures, higher energy levels are less populated. Since the transition is between two energy levels with ΔE corresponding to a 1448 Å photon, we can calculate that energy difference.

Wait, first, let's clarify the observed ratio. If the ratio n2/n1 decreases when the star has spots, then when spots are present, there's a lower population in level 2 relative to level 1 compared to when no spots are present.

But in the Boltzmann equation, the ratio n2/n1 is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(kT)). If temperature decreases (from 6000K to 5500K), the exponent becomes more negative (since T is in the denominator), hence the ratio n2/n1 would decrease. Therefore, the observed ratio n2/n1 is lower in the presence of spots. That seems straightforward. So even if the star is a mix of temperatures, perhaps we can take the effective temperature as the temperature governing the ionization/excitation? But typically, the effective temperature relates to the total flux; line ratios are determined by the local temperature where the lines are formed. If spots are cooler regions producing lines in their own regions, then the overall line strength would depend on the filling factor. So, but LTE is still valid, so each region has its own temperature. Then, the equivalent width or the line depth would be some average. So, if we have two regions with temperatures T_hot = 6000 K and T_cool = (unknown; maybe (we need to find T_cool?)) but the problem gives Teff drops to 5500 K. But we need to see how they average.

But perhaps here the question is in fact simpler. The problem mentions the photospheric effective temperature—maybe that's the temperature assumed for the entire photosphere in LTE, so when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, they average the temperature in some way. But the key point given in the question is that the overall Teff is 5500 K when the star is 40% spotted, and 6000 K when unspotted. So, when the star has spots, maybe the line ratio is computed based on the effective temperature of 5500 K. However, that might not account for the actual two-component nature. But perhaps given LTE and the effective temperature (not specifying it's a composite), they just assume the whole photosphere is at 5500 K when spotted? The problem says "the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K"—so rather than modeling two regions, they just use this Teff as the photospheric temperature.

Alternatively, the problem might expect us to compute the ratio using the overall Teff when spotted and when unspotted. That is, ratio at 6000 K vs 5500 K, regardless of actual inhomogeneities. However, in reality, spots would lead to two temperatures contributing to the line formation, but given the information here, maybe the problem wants us to just take the Teff when spotted and compare the Boltzmann factors. Since the problem states "the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K", maybe they are considering that the photosphere as a whole is modeled with an effective temperature of 5500 K when 40% is covered with spots, and 6000 K otherwise. Hence, under LTE, we can compute the ratio n1/n2 as per the Boltzmann equation for these two temperatures.

Wait, the question says: "What is the factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots?" So, we have ratio_no_spots / ratio_with_spots. The ratio being n1/n2 or n2/n1? The problem states "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2)" has been observed to decrease when the star has spots. So, if the ratio is n1/n2, and it decreases when the star has spots, that would mean that n1/n2_with_spots < n1/n2_no_spots. Alternatively, if the ratio is n2/n1, then a decrease would mean n2/n1_with_spots < n2/n1_no_spots. But we need to be careful here.

Assuming the ratio in question is n_upper/n_lower (as per the Boltzmann factor). But in spectroscopy, the ratio is usually written as lower level over upper level if it's absorption lines. However, the problem states it's the ratio of the number of neutral atoms in two energy levels. So, perhaps it's just n1/n2 or n2/n1. Wait, the energy levels: level 1 and level 2, but the problem says the ratio (n1/n2) decreases when spots are present. That would imply that when temperature decreases, n1/n2 decreases. But let's check.

If we have, according to Boltzmann, n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(kT)).

Assuming that the statistical weights g2 and g1 are the same (if not given otherwise). If we don't have information about the statistical weights, maybe they cancel out, so the ratio n2/n1 is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(kT)). If ΔE is positive (level 2 higher than level 1), as required by the transition (since a photon of 1448 Å is emitted when an electron drops from level 2 to 1), then ΔE = E2 - E1 = hc/λ.

Therefore, if temperature T decreases, exponent becomes more negative, so exp term is smaller, hence n2/n1 decreases. So the ratio n2/n1 decreases when T decreases, which corresponds to spots (since the star is cooler when spots are present). Then the problem states the ratio *decreases* when the star has spots. So if the ratio in question is n2/n1, then that makes sense: the ratio decreases when T decreases. Therefore, the factor by which the ratio changes would be [n2/n1]_no_spots / [n2/n1]_with_spots = exp(-ΔE/(k*T_no_spots)) / exp(-ΔE/(k*T_with_spots)) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T_with_spots - 1/T_no_spots) )

However, if the question is posed as the ratio of "the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2)", so it's n1/n2 versus spots. If that's the case, then ratio (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(kT)). If that ratio decreases when the star has spots (which is when T decreases), that would also make sense because exp(ΔE/(kT)) increases as T decreases, but g1/g2 might be a constant. But since we don't know, assuming the ratio they refer to is n2/n1, which is exp(-ΔE/(kT)) multiplied by g2/g1, but since they mention the ratio decreases with spots, that would correspond to the ratio n2/n1 decreasing when T decreases. Therefore, the simplest assumption is that it's n2/n1.

But regardless, since the question is asking for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does have spots, we need to compute the ratio_no_spots / ratio_with_spots. Let's define ratio = n_upper/n_lower (assuming upper is level 2, lower is level 1). So if that's the case, ratio_no_spots / ratio_with_spots = [ (g2/g1 exp(-ΔE/(k T_no)) ) ] / [ (g2/g1 exp(-ΔE/(k T_with)) ) ] = exp( -ΔE/(k T_no) + ΔE/(k T_with) ) = exp( ΔE/k (1/T_with - 1/T_no) )

Since ΔE = hc/λ, substituting in:

Factor = exp( (hc)/(λ k) (1/T_with - 1/T_no) )

So if we calculate this exponent, that's the natural logarithm of the factor. So let's compute this.

First, we need the value of ΔE, which is hc/λ. We can compute hc in units that make sense with the given wavelength in Angstroms.

h = Planck's constant = 6.62607015e-34 J s

c = speed of light = 3.0e8 m/s

λ = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m

ΔE = hc / λ = (6.626e-34 J s)(3.0e8 m/s) / (1448e-10 m)

First calculate numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3.0e8 = 1.9878e-25 J m

Divide by 1448e-10 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1448e-10 = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = (1.9878 / 1.448) * 10^(-25 +7) = approximately 1.373 * 10^-18 J

So ΔE ≈ 1.373e-18 J per photon.

But Boltzmann's constant k is 1.380649e-23 J/K.

So the exponent becomes:

ΔE/(k) (1/T_with - 1/T_no) = (1.373e-18 J) / (1.380649e-23 J/K) * (1/5500 K - 1/6000 K)

Compute ΔE/k: 1.373e-18 / 1.380649e-23 ≈ (1.373 / 1.380649) * 10^5 ≈ approximately 0.99485 * 1e5 ≈ 9.9485e4 K.

Then compute (1/5500 - 1/6000):

1/5500 ≈ 0.000181818

1/6000 ≈ 0.000166667

Difference: 0.000181818 - 0.000166667 ≈ 0.000015151 K^(-1)

Then multiplying: 9.9485e4 K * 0.000015151 K^(-1) ≈ 9.9485e4 * 1.5151e-5 ≈ approx 1.508.

Therefore, the exponent is approx 1.508.

Therefore, the factor is exp(1.508) ≈ e^1.508 ≈ 4.515.

So the ratio without spots is approximately 4.5 times higher than when spots are present. Therefore, the factor by which the ratio changes is about 4.5. Thus, the answer would be approximately 4.5. However, let's check my calculations step by step to be precise because the numbers may need more accurate computation.

First, compute ΔE:

λ = 1448 Angstroms = 1448e-10 m.

hc = 6.62607015e-34 J s * 3e8 m/s = 1.987821045e-25 J m

ΔE = 1.987821045e-25 J m / 1448e-10 m = 1.987821045e-25 / 1.448e-7 = 1.987821045 / 1.448 * 1e-18 ≈ 1.3726e-18 J

So ΔE ≈ 1.3726e-18 J.

ΔE / k = 1.3726e-18 / 1.380649e-23 ≈ 1.3726 / 1.380649 * 1e5 ≈ 0.99418 * 1e5 ≈ 99418 K.

Wait, that's more precise. Then, difference in 1/T:

1/5500 - 1/6000 = (6000 - 5500)/(5500*6000) = 500 / (33,000,000) = 1 / 66,000 ≈ 1.51515e-5 K^-1.

Multiply ΔE/K by this:

99,418 K * 1.51515e-5 K^-1 = 99,418 * 1.51515e-5 ≈ Let's compute 99,418 * 1.51515e-5.

First, note that 1.51515e-5 is approximately 0.0000151515.

So 99,418 * 0.0000151515 ≈ 99,418 * 1.51515e-5

Compute 100,000 * 1.51515e-5 = 1.51515

But since it's 99,418, subtract 582 * 1.51515e-5. 

58 * 1.51515e-5 = approx 58 * 0.0000151515 ≈ 0.000878787

Thus, approx:

1.51515 - 0.000878787 ≈ 1.51427

But more precisely:

1.51515 - (582 * 1.51515e-5) = 1.51515*(1 - 582/100,000) = 1.51515*(0.99418) ≈ 1.51515 - 1.51515*0.00582 ≈ 1.51515 - 0.00883 ≈ 1.50632.

Therefore, approximate total exponent is ~1.5063.

Therefore, exp(1.5063) ≈ value.

We know that e^1 = 2.718, e^1.6 is ~4.953, e^1.5 = 4.4817. Let's check:

e^1.5 ≈ 4.4817

Since 1.5063 is 0.0063 more.

The derivative of e^x is e^x, so approximate the increase:

delta_x = 0.0063, e^(1.5 + 0.0063) ≈ e^1.5 * (1 + 0.0063) ≈ 4.4817 * 1.0063 ≈ 4.4817 + 4.4817*0.0063 ≈ 4.4817 + 0.02823 ≈ 4.510.

So approximates to around 4.51.

Therefore, the factor is approximately 4.5. Alternatively, calculate more accurately using exponent:

Calculate 1.5063.

Wait, let's use more precise exponents:

natural exponent of 1.5063.

ln(4.5) ≈ 1.504077. So 1.5063 is slightly higher. Let's compute:

We know that e^1.504077 ≈ 4.5.

So e^1.5063 = e^(1.504077 + 0.002223) = e^1.504077 * e^0.002223 ≈ 4.5 * (1 + 0.002223 + (0.002223)^2/2) ≈ 4.5 * 1.002225 ≈ 4.5 + 4.5*0.002225 ≈ 4.5 + 0.01001 ≈ 4.51001.

Therefore, approximately 4.51.

But since in the exponent computation, we approximated earlier steps, perhaps the exact value is necessary. Alternatively, maybe the problem wants algebra. Let's double-check calculations.

Alternatively, using energy in terms of eV, but that might complicate more.

Wait, perhaps using the relation between energy and temperature:

ΔE/k = hc/(λ k)

So,

ΔE/(k) = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10 * 1.38e-23)

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25

Denominator:1448e-10 * 1.38e-23 = 1448 * 1.38e-33 = 1998.24e-33 = 1.99824e-30

Therefore,

ΔE/k = 1.9878e-25 / 1.99824e-30 ≈ (1.9878 / 1.99824) * 10^5 ≈ 0.9948 * 1e5 ≈ 9.948e4 K

Which is 99,480 K. So 99,480 K*(1/5500 -1/6000)=99,480*(0.000181818 -0.000166667)≈99,480*0.000015151≈1.508. Yep, that matches.

So the exponent is approx 1.508, so e^1.508≈4.51 as before. So factor is approx 4.5.

But to be precise, what is 1.508 exactly?

Compute 1.508 in exponent.

But to compute 1.508:

Let me use calculator steps. We can use e^1.508 ≈.

We can recall that ln(4) ≈ 1.386, ln(5) ≈ 1.609, so 1.508 is between ln(4.5) approx 1.504 and then.

Wait, natural logarithms for key values:

ln(4) ≈ 1.386294

ln(4.5) ≈ 1.504077

ln(4.6) ≈ 1.526056

So ln(4.5) is 1.504, ln(4.51)=?

Since ln(4.5)=1.504077

How much more for 4.51?

d/dx ln(x) =1/x, so approx:

ln(4.5 +0.01)= ln(4.5) + (0.01)/4.5 ≈ 1.504077 + 0.002222≈1.5063. So ln(4.51)= approx. 1.5063. Therefore, e^1.508≈4.51* e^(0.0017)≈4.51*(1 +0.0017)≈4.518. More accurately, what is e^1.508:

We can write 1.508 = 1.5 + 0.008

We know e^1.5≈4.4817 (since e^0.5=1.6487, e^1=2.718, so e^1.5= e^1 *e^0.5≈2.718*1.6487≈4.4816)

Then e^0.008≈1 +0.008 +0.008²/2≈1.008032

Thus e^1.508≈4.4816*1.008032≈4.4816 +4.4816*0.008=4.4816 +0.03585≈4.5175≈4.518

Thus, approximately 4.52. So, the conclusion is the factor is approximately 4.5.

But, given that the possible error from the approximated values might accrue. The question is probably expecting such an answer, but maybe we have to compute with precise calculation. Let's try using Wolfram alpha-like estimates:

But in an exam setting without a calculator, exponential values are estimated. But given that it can be calculated precisely, it's necessary. However, maybe we can use the following approach:

The key formula is:

ratio_no_spots / ratio_with_spots = exp( ((hc)/(k λ))(1/T_spots - 1/T_no_spots) )

Note that 1/T_spots is 1/5500, 1/T_no_spots is 1/6000. So the difference is 1/5500 -1/6000. Wait, but in the exponent, it's (1/T_with_spots - 1/T_no). Wait no, according to earlier step:

Original exponent (how we set up) is:

= (hc/(λ k))(1/T_with_spots - 1/T_no_spots). Need to confirm the sign.

We have:

ratio_no / ratio_with = exp( (ΔE/k)(1/T_with - 1/T_no) )

Wait in previous steps, 6000 is T_no_spots, 5500 is T_with. So,

= (ΔE/k) (1/5500 -1/6000)

But ΔE/k = hc/(λ k)

So,

(hc/(λ k))(1/T_with -1/T_no) = (6.626e-34 *3e8/(1448e-10 *1.38e-23))*(1/5500 -1/6000)

Compute all values here step by step.

First compute hc/(λ k):

= (6.626e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s) / (1448e-10 m * 1.38e-23 J/K)

Numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m

Denominator:1448e-10 *1.38e-23 = 1448e-10*1.38e-23= 1448*1.38 *1e-33= 1999.  approximately 2000 *1e-33=2e-30 J·m/K

So hc/(λ k) = 1.9878e-25 /2e-30 ≈ 1.9878/2 * 1e5= 0.9939 *1e5=99,390 K.

Then multiply by (1/5500 -1/6000):

First compute 1/5500 = 0.000181818..., 1/6000=0.000166666..., difference ≈0.0000151515

So total exponent is 99,390 *0.0000151515≈ computing that as 99,390 *0.0000151515. Let's compute:

99,390 *0.00001 =0.9939

99,390 *0.0000051515≈99,390*0.000005=0.49695, 99,390*0.0000001515≈0.01505

Total exponent:0.9939+0.49695+0.01505≈0.9939+0.512≈1.5059≈1.506

Thus, exp(1.506) ≈ 4.51

Alternate way: if you work in terms of 1e4 K units:

Actually 99,390 K ≈9.939e4 K

9.939e4 K*(1/5500 -1/6000).

Hmm.

Alternatively,

9.939e4 * (6000 -5500)/ (5500*6000) ) =9.939e4 * 500 / (33,000,000) =9.939e4 *5 / 330,000= (9.939e4 / 66,000)*5≈ (0.1487e1)*5=1.487*5≈7.435≈ value? Wait, wait no: Hold on.

Wait, the expression was:

(ΔE / k) * (1/5500 -1/6000) = (99,390 K) * (1/5500 -1/6000 )

But 1/5500 -1/6000 is (6000 -5500)/ (5500*6000) =500/(33,000,000)=1/66,000≈0.0000151515.

So (ΔE / k ) * ( delta (1/T) )=99,390 K *0.0000151515≈1.506

So exponent is 1.506

So e^1.506≈the same as before≈4.51. So the factor by which the ratio decreases would be approx 4.5.

Concluding that when there are no spots, the ratio is approx 4.5 times higher than when there are spots. So the factor is 4.5. Since the problem asks for the factor by which the ratio changes from no spots to spots is 4.5.

Wait, perhaps depending on whether the ratio is n1/n2 or n2/n1. Let's check.

We need to define the ratio given by the Boltzmann equation: n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(kT)). Assuming the level 2 is higher than level 1. So when the temperature decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so n2/n1 decreases. Thus, when spots are present (lower T), n2/n1 is smaller. The problem states that the ratio (n of level 1 to level 2) is observed to decrease when the star has spots. Wait, the problem says the ratio of the number of neutral atoms in levels 1 and 2, so n1/n2. Wait, problem statement exactly says:

 "...the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2)... [has] decreased when the star has spots."

So n1/n2 is observed to decrease when spots are present.

If n1/n2 decreases, that means either n1 decreases or n2 increases. In an LTE scenario, when the temperature decreases (cooler), the population in the higher energy level (n2) will decrease, so n1/n2 would increase. Wait, this is conflicting. If temperature decreases, NT check:

At higher temperatures, more atoms are excited to higher energy levels. If temperature decreases, the population in the upper level should decrease, thus n2 decreases more than n1. If so, the ratio n1/n2 (which is (n1)/(n2)) would increase. But the problem states the ratio decreases? That is in contradiction.

Wait, maybe the problem actually refers to n2/n1.

The problem states: the ratio of the number of neutral atoms in level 1 and level 2 has been observed to decrease. If the ratio in question is n1/n2， and you have n1/n2 decreases when T decreases, but according to the Boltzmann equation, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(kT)).

 Since ΔE is positive, as E2 > E1. So exp(ΔE/(kT)) increases with decrease in T (since T is in denominator), (because ΔE is positive). So n1/n2 increases as T decreases.

However, the problem states that this ratio decreases when there are spots. That contradicts.

 Alternatively, it's n2/n1, which would decrease with T. Let's check.

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(kT)).  If you decrease T, exp(-ΔE/(kT)) becomes smaller, hence n2/n1 decreases. So ratios decrease when spots(T lower), so if the ratio presented is n2/n1 then, with lower T, ratio drops. But according to the problem, astronomers observe that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So the ratio being referred to must be n2/n1.

 However, the problem says ratio of number of atoms in level 1 and level 2. Just says the ratio, which could be written either way. But if n1/n2 decreases when T decreases, which is n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(kT)), meaning when T decreases, exponents get larger, so exp(ΔE/(kT)) increases. So if n1/n2 = constant * exp(ΔE/(kT)), lower T means larger ΔE/(kT) so n1/n2 increases. Therefore, the problem states the ratio *decreases*, which supposes that it's measuring n2/n1; hence, to reconcile, if n2/n1 decreases when T decreases.

 Hence, prior calculation: we have n2/n1 ratio when no spots over n2/n1 ratio when spots= exp((ΔE/k)(1/Tspots -1/Tno)).

 Wait our original calculation leads to this factor as 4.5. So depends on the wording. Original assumption in the calculation was correct. Even if the problem had different ratio direction, but that might affect interpretation.

 Now considering the confusion:

Given that the problem states that " the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2), astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots."

If the ratio is defined as n1/n2, but they say it decreases when star has spots. Conversely, since lower T mean less excitation, n2 is lower, implying n1/n2 will increase. Contradicts.problem statement.

Therefore, it must be that the ratio refers to n2/n1.

But clearly, considering the definitions, whether the quotient is level 1 over 2 or vice versa is pivotal.

But given the Boltzmann factor and in spectroscopy, lines from lower to upper level, with population ratio n_upper/n_lower. Depending on LS coupling, but generally, the strength of a line depends on the abundance in the lower level ((n_lower)). However, if it's an emission line, it could depend on the upper.

But this is complicating, perhaps not necessary here. Suppose the ratio they refer to is n1/n2. Then in their observation when stellar spots (cooler regions, T has lower), they observe the ratio n1/n2 decreases, which using n1/n2 = g1/g2 exp ( + (E1 - E2)/(kT) )= (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(kT)) ie similar to n2/n1 / (g2/g1). That doesn’t seem?

Wait, wait:

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(kT)), so rearranged => n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(kT))

Assuming n1 is lower energy level (E1), n2 upper (E2), delta E=E2 -E1

So n1/n2 = g1/g2 exp( (E2 -E1)/(kT)) which inverses.

So in this case, lower T will lead to Grater exponent: if E2 -E1 is positive, then (E2 -E1)/(kT) reduces as T increases, so exp(factor) is larger when T is low: wait,

If T increases, denominator increases, so (E2-E1)/(kT) is smaller, exp(small number) is larger when it's increasing for negative exponents. But wait, (E2 - E1) is positive, divided by kT positive, so (Delta E)/(kT) positives;

Reasoning again if T is high,

if T higher,

if higher T, (E2 - E1)/(kT) increases? Wait positive degrees Delta E over T: Negative relationship.

Wait no. If T increases, (E2 - E1)/(k T) decreases? Exactly : example, if T was 10000:

Amount_Q = (E2 - E1)/(k*T) = ( positive) / larger T: yields a smaller positive number.

So exp(Amount_Q) is less when T increases.

But there's lack of negative sign in the exponent here. So here:

n1/n2 = (g1/g2) e^{(ΔE)/(kT)}

If temp increases, the exponent (ΔE / (kT)} becomes smaller, so the exponential term grows slower. For example, when T approaches infinity, the exponent becomes close to zero, so n1/n2 tends to g1/g2.

But when temperature decreases, (ΔE/(kT)) increases, so the exponential term becomes larger. Hence, n1/n2 increases as T decreases. Which would contradict the problem statement where the ratio (n1/n2) is observed to decrease when the star has spots (i.e., lower T). Hence, a contradiction.

That means, expectation and observation are in conflict, unless the ratio is viewed as n2/n1.

Indeed, if we use the ratio n2/n1.

n2 /n1 = (g2/g1) e^{ - ΔE/(k T) }

If T decreases, ΔE/(k T) increases, so ( - ΔE/(k T)) decreases, exponent gets more negative, so n2/n1 decreases. So when star has lower T (spots), n2/n1 ratio decreases. This aligns with the problem statement: when spots are present (lower T), ratio (n2/n1 )is lower. Therefore, assume that the ratio in the problem is n2/n1.

Therefore, computing the factor by which this ratio changes when the star has no spots compared to when it does is (n2/n1)_no_spots / (n2/n1)_with_spots = exp(ΔE/k (1/T_spots - 1/T_no))

Previously computed the factor about 4.5. This is because higher temperatures yield higher n2/n1 ratios (but actuallyn raise as n2/n1_with_spots, but T_no is higher: T1 is 6000K and A factor of, so cold.

So the exponent should be:

( ΔE / k )(1/Ts -1/Tn )

Where Ts= spot， 5500K and Tn=no spot=6000K

So, ∆E /k = hc / (lambda k)≈9.948e4 K ==>∆E /k=99,480 K

Then this multiplied by (1/5500 - 1/6000)

As above:

Δ=(1/5500 -1/6000)= 1/(5500) -1/6000≈1.818e-4 -1.6667e-4≈1.514e-5

So multiply :99,480 * 1.514e-5≈1.506 =>exp(1.506)≈4.51

Thus. The ratio when the star does not have spots compared to when it does is multiplied by a factor of approximately 4.5.

Therefore, the answer is about 4.5. Expressing this with a box.

**Final Answer**
The factor by which the ratio changes is \boxed{4.5}.
