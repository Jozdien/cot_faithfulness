# Original Question

Observations of structures located at a distance of about 2.1 gigaparsecs (2.1 Gpc) are being carried out. The detected absorption line energy equivalent is about 3.9 micro electron volts (3.9 * 10^-6 eV).

What is most likely to be observed with this absorption line in the Milky Way?

# R1 response

The observed absorption line at 3.9 µeV corresponds to a rest energy of approximately 5.9 µeV when accounting for redshift. This matches the 21 cm hyperfine transition of neutral hydrogen (rest frequency 1.42 GHz), a fundamental spectral line in radio astronomy. The redshift calculation aligns with the structure's distance (2.1 Gpc ≈ z ≈ 0.5), confirming that the absorption line in the Milky Way is most likely the **21 cm hydrogen line** observed in the radio spectrum. 

**Answer:**  
The absorption line is most likely the 21 cm line of neutral hydrogen in the Milky Way.

# R1 reasoning

Alright, let's tackle this question. So, we're observing structures 2.1 gigaparsecs away, and there's an absorption line at 3.9 microeV. We need to figure out what this corresponds to in the Milky Way. Hmm, okay. 

First, let me recall what absorption lines are. They're dark lines in a spectrum caused by gas or dust absorbing photons at specific energies, right? Each element or molecule has its own set of absorption lines, so this should be about identifying the element or molecule that has a transition at 3.9 microeV.

Wait, 3.9 microelectron volts. Let me convert that to a more familiar unit. Energy in electron volts can relate to wavelength via E = hc/λ. Let me remember h is Planck's constant, about 4.1357×10^-15 eV·s, and c is the speed of light, roughly 3×10^8 m/s. So λ = hc/E. Let me compute that.

E is 3.9e-6 eV. So λ = (4.1357e-15 eV·s * 3e8 m/s) / 3.9e-6 eV. Let's calculate the numerator: 4.1357e-15 * 3e8 = 1.2407e-6 eV·m. Divided by 3.9e-6 eV: 1.2407e-6 / 3.9e-6 ≈ 0.318 meters. So approximately 0.32 meters, which is in the radio wavelength range, since radio waves are from about 1 mm to 100 km. So this is 32 cm, which is definitely in the radio part of the spectrum.

Wait, normally absorption lines are observed in optical, UV, or maybe X-ray if it's high energy. But radio absorption lines? Could it be something like the 21 cm line of hydrogen? But that's a very specific wavelength, 21 cm. Wait, 21 cm is 0.21 meters. The wavelength we calculated here is 0.32 meters. Doesn't match. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe this is redshifted. The structure is at 2.1 Gpc, so we need to compute the redshift. For that, we need the Hubble constant. Let's see. H0 is around 70 km/s/Mpc. But if the object is 2.1 Gpc away, then using Hubble's law, v = H0 * d. Wait, H0 is 70 km/s/Mpc, so for 2.1 Gpc (which is 2100 Mpc), v = 70 * 2100 = 147,000 km/s. Hmm, but the speed of light is ~300,000 km/s, so 147,000 km/s would be a significant redshift. Redshift z = v/c = 147000 / 300000 ≈ 0.49. Wait, but Hubble's law is an approximation for small z. At this large distance, maybe we need to use the cosmological redshift formula. Oh right, redshift z is related to the scale factor. But perhaps for the sake of this problem, even if we use the simple Hubble's law, but maybe the redshift is actually from the cosmological expansion. Wait, objects at 2.1 Gpc, given the age and expansion of the universe, but perhaps their redshift is more than z=0.49. Let me check.

Alternatively, maybe the question is assuming that the observed energy is in the rest frame, and we need to compute the corresponding observed energy. Wait, wait, the observed absorption line has an energy equivalent of 3.9 micro eV. But in the Milky Way, without redshift, the same line would have a different energy? So the energy we observe is from the distant object, which is redshifted. So if the line is at 3.9 microeV in our observed frame, then in the rest frame (Milky Way), it would be higher energy. Because when things are redshifted, the observed wavelength is longer (lower energy) than emitted. So higher energy in rest frame would be blueshifted. Wait, but absorption lines are caused by intervening material. Wait, no. If we observe absorption lines from a distant object, the absorption occurs either in the interstellar medium of our galaxy, or in the intergalactic medium, or in the intervening material. But the question is asking what is most likely to be observed with this absorption line in the Milky Way. Wait, maybe confusion here. The absorption line is detected in the spectrum of a distant object, so the absorption is due to something between us and the object, either in the Milky Way or in an intervening galaxy or the intergalactic medium. But the question is, in the Milky Way, what would this absorption line correspond to? So perhaps this line, at its rest wavelength in the Milky Way, but when observed in the distant object's light, it's redshifted to 3.9 microeV. Wait, this is getting a bit tricky. Let's think carefully.

Suppose that a cloud in the Milky Way has an absorption line at some energy E_rest. When we observe a distant object at redshift z, any absorption due to the Milky Way would be at E_observed = E_rest / (1+z), right? Because the Milky Way's absorption is in our rest frame, but if the source is at a redshift z, then the entire spectrum of the source is redshifted. So the absorption lines from the Milky Way would appear at E_rest/(1+z). Wait, no, actually no, because the Milky Way is at z=0. If we observe a distant object, the light from the object passes through the Milky Way, which is at rest with respect to us. So the absorption lines produced by the Milky Way would not be redshifted. However, absorption lines produced by clouds in the distant galaxy or along the line of sight but at a different redshift would have their own redshifts. So in this case, the question might be implying that this 3.9 microeV absorption line is from an intervening structure at 2.1 Gpc. Therefore, to find what corresponds to this in the Milky Way, we need to de-redshift it to z=0. Hmm, okay, that makes sense. So first, we need to compute the redshift corresponding to 2.1 Gpc. Then, apply that redshift to calculate the rest energy of the line. Then identify what transition that corresponds to in the Milky Way.

So first, let's compute the redshift z corresponding to a distance of 2.1 Gpc. For this, we need a cosmological model. Let's assume a standard ΛCDM model. Maybe the question expects a simple Hubble's law approximation. Let me check. Given H0 ≈ 70 km/s/Mpc, then for d = 2.1 Gpc = 2100 Mpc. Then v = H0 * d = 70 * 2100 = 147,000 km/s. But since c is ~300,000 km/s, this would give a redshift z = v/c ≈ 147,000 / 300,000 ≈ 0.49. However, Hubble's law isn't accurate at such large distances; it's only valid for small z. To get the exact redshift for a comoving distance of 2.1 Gpc, we need to integrate the Friedmann equation. But since this is probably beyond the scope, the problem might want an approximate value. Alternatively, maybe they consider the lookback time or the light travel distance. Alternatively, using the cosmological redshift calculator. Let me see if I can recall or find a rough estimate of redshift for 2.1 Gpc.

Alternatively, maybe some approximate relation. For example, the comoving distance D_c is related to redshift z via, in a flat universe, D_c = c/H0 ∫0^z dz' / E(z'), where E(z) = sqrt(Ω_m(1+z)^3 + Ω_Λ). With H0=70, Ω_m≈0.3, Ω_Λ≈0.7. For z=0.5, comoving distance is roughly 1700 Mpc. At z=1, about 3300 Mpc. Wait, so maybe 2.1 Gpc is around z≈0.67. Wait, values vary, but maybe there is a standard table or so. Alternatively, since the calculation is perhaps more detailed than necessary, maybe the question expects using z ~ 0.5 (since 2.1 Gpc is about 7000 Mpc? Wait, no, 2.1 Gpc is 2100 Mpc). Wait, perhaps using the age of the universe and expansion. Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed to use Hubble's law despite its inaccuracy here. If we take z=0.49 as previously, then the rest energy of the absorption line would be E_rest = E_observed * (1 + z) ≈ 3.9e-6 eV * 1.49 ≈ 5.8e-6 eV.

Alternatively, if z is higher, say 0.7, then 1+z = 1.7, E_rest ≈ 3.9e-6 * 1.7 ≈ 6.6e-6 eV. But the exact value may not matter so much as identifying the line. However, 3.9 microeV corresponds to a wavelength λ ≈ 0.318 m (as calculated before), rest frame wavelength would be λ_rest = λ_observed / (1 + z). If observed wavelength is 0.318 m, then rest wavelength 0.318 / (1 + z). For example, if z=0.49, λ_rest ≈ 0.318 /1.49 ≈ 0.213 m = 21.3 cm. Ah! That's the famous 21 cm line of neutral hydrogen. The 21 cm line is a hyperfine transition in neutral hydrogen, with a wavelength of 21 cm (0.21 meters), corresponding to an energy of about (using E = hc/lambda) h=6.626e-34 J·s, c=3e8 m/s. Let's compute the energy in eV: E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (0.21 m) = 9.47e-26 J. Convert to eV: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so E=(9.47e-26)/(1.602e-19)= ~5.91e-7 eV, which is 0.591 microeV. Wait, that seems different. But earlier I found that rest energy was about 5.8e-6 eV. There's a discrepancy here. What's going on?

Wait, so the 21 cm line has a wavelength of 0.21 meters. Let's compute the energy. Planck constant h is 4.1357e-15 eV·s. So E = hc / λ = (4.1357e-15 eV·s)(3e8 m/s)/(0.21 m) = (1.2407e-6 eV·m)/(0.21 m)= 5.9e-6 eV. 5.9 micro eV. Wait, that's different from previous. So seems like I made a mistake earlier. When I compute via Joules, errors could come in powers of ten. Let me recalculate:

E in eV: (hc)/lambda. h=4.1357e-15 eV·s, c=3e8 m/s, lambda in meters. So hc = 4.1357e-15 * 3e8 = 1.2407e-6 eV·m. Divide by lambda in meters. For 0.21 m: 1.2407e-6 / 0.21 = 5.908e-6 eV ≈ 5.9 microeV. So the 21 cm line corresponds to 5.9 microeV.

But the rest energy here was calculated (from E_observed 3.9 microeV and z=0.49) to be 5.8e-6 eV, which is about 5.8 microeV. Close to 5.9 microeV. So maybe the absorption line observed at 3.9 microeV (after being redshifted by z≈0.49) corresponds to the rest energy of about 5.8 microeV, which is very close to the 21 cm line's 5.9 microeV. Given that the 21 cm line is very prominent in the Milky Way, used to map hydrogen, this seems likely.

But why then with a structure at 2.1 Gpc, the observed line would be at 3.9 microeV? So in other words, if the rest energy is 5.9 microeV for the 21 cm line, then to observe 3.9 microeV, which is 5.9 / (1+z) ≈3.9. So (1+z)=5.9 /3.9≈1.51. Therefore, z≈0.51. Which would correspond to a comoving distance? With z≈0.5 and H0=70, using Hubble's law, d = cz/H0 = (0.51*3e5 km/s)/70 km/s/Mpc≈(1.53e5)/70≈2185 Mpc≈2.2 Gpc. Which is approximately the 2.1 Gpc given in the problem. So this all lines up.

So summarizing: the observed absorption line at 3.9 microeV is redshifted 21 cm radiation (5.9 microeV rest) from hydrogen in a structure at z≈0.5 (distance ~2.1 Gpc). Therefore, in the Milky Way (unshifted), this corresponds to the 21 cm line of neutral hydrogen.

But wait, another thought. Wait, the 21 cm line is a radio emission line, typically. But maybe if there's a cloud of neutral hydrogen, the 21 cm line can be seen in absorption if there's a background source. For example, if we have a bright radio source behind a hydrogen cloud, the hydrogen would absorb at 21 cm. However, normally the 21 cm line is observed in emission. But in absorption, you need a bright background source. However, in intergalactic medium or galactic clouds, this can occur.

But the problem states that the observation is of structures at 2.1 Gpc, so the absorption line is detected in those structures. Therefore, this is extragalactic, but the question is, if we were to observe that same line in the Milky Way (without redshift), what would it be? Given that the energy we observe from the distant structure (3.9 microeV) is the redshifted version of the rest frame energy (≈5.9 microeV), then the same line in the Milky Way would be at 21 cm, neutral hydrogen.

Therefore, the answer is the 21 cm line of neutral hydrogen.

But wait, let me cross-check for possible other transitions. Are there any other lines with similar energies? Let's see.

Another common absorption line is the Lyman-alpha line, which is at about 121.6 nm, which is ultraviolet. Let's compute its energy. E = hc / λ. λ = 121.6e-9 m. hc=1.24e-6 eV·m, so E=1.24e-6 /121.6e-9≈10.2 eV. Which is much higher energy than the microelectron volts we're talking about here. Similarly, other optical lines (e.g., H-alpha, sodium D lines) have eV or fractions of eV energies, not micro eV. 

In the microwave, you have transitions like the CO lines, but those are rotational transitions with lower energies, but even CO(1-0) is around 115 GHz. Let's compute energy: E = h*nu. h is 4.1357e-15 eV·s. 115 GHz=115e9 Hz. So E=4.1357e-15 * 115e9=4.76e-4 eV, 476 microeV, which is much higher than 3.9 microeV. So not CO.

What about the hyperfine transition of hydrogen? As we discussed, that's 21 cm. The only one I know in the radio that's common. Then there's the OH lines, e.g., at 18 cm, which is about similar wavelength. Let me check that. 18 cm is approximately 18 cm, so E=1.24e-6 / 0.18 ≈6.89e-6 eV (~6.89 microeV). Wait, so OH lines at 18 cm would have higher energy (lower wavelength) than the hydrogen line. So if we observed 3.9 microeV, that would push the rest frame energy to, say, 5.8 microeV (with z≈0.5). The OH 18 cm line would rest at ~6.89 microeV, so if observed at 3.9, that would require (1+z)=6.89/3.9≈1.76, z≈0.76, which would correspond to larger distance. But given that the 2.1 Gpc in the problem gives us z≈0.5 for the 21 cm, perhaps it matches better with hydrogen. Therefore, the closest candidate is hydrogen 21 cm.

Is there any other contender? Maybe electron spin-flip transitions or something else, but in the Milky Way, the predominant and well-known one is the 21 cm hydrogen line.

Another check: convert the observed energy to frequency. E=3.9e-6 eV. E = h*nu => nu = E/h. h=4.1357e-15 eV·s, so nu = 3.9e-6 /4.1357e-15 ≈9.43e8 Hz≈943 MHz. That's in the radio range. So if we de-redshift that with z=0.5, rest frame frequency is 943*(1+z)=943*1.5≈1.415 GHz. The 21 cm line is 1.42 GHz, perfect match. The hydrogen hyperfine transition is exactly at about 1.42040575177 GHz. That's spot on. So frequency observed is about 0.943 GHz. The rest frame is about 1.42 GHz. So yeah, the H I 21 cm line. Therefore, the answer must be the 21 cm line.

Also, given the problem mentions absorption line: observing a background radio source (like a quasar) shining through a cloud of neutral hydrogen would produce absorption at 21 cm. Though traditionally, we observe 21 cm in emission from our galaxy, but absorption against a background source is also possible, especially if the hydrogen is cold. So I think this all makes sense. So the absorption line observed at 3.9 microeV from 2.1 Gpc corresponds to redshifted 21 cm line, so in the Milky Way, it's the 21 cm hydrogen line.
