# Original Question

You want to study the role of the GADD45G protein in a mouse model. You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. You decide to create a transgenic mouse model with the inducible overexpression of the coding sequence for the GADD45G gene. You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus. For that purpose, you will modify the gene's coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein. You genetically engineer the plasmid and, aided by Lipofectamine®, transfect it into the Chinese hamster ovary cells. You select the antibiotic-resistant cell colonies to test the expression level of your construct. Once you begin, you observe that you are unable to overexpress your protein as you expected. In the series of tests you undertake to identify the cause, you realize that the sequence of the plus strand of your construct reads:

# R1 reasoning

Okay, so I need to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't being overexpressed as expected in the transgenic mouse model. Let's go through the problem step by step. 

First, the researcher inserted a plasmid with the GADD45G coding sequence modified to include an HA tag (influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant) at the N-terminus. They transfected CHO cells using Lipofectamine, selected antibiotic-resistant colonies, but the protein isn't expressing well. The provided DNA sequence is the plus strand of the construct.

The first thing I should check is the construct design. Maybe there's a problem with the HA tag insertion. Let's look at the beginning of the sequence. The HA tag is usually a short peptide, like theYPYDVPDYA epitope, which corresponds to the DNA sequence TATCCATATGATGTACCAGATTACGC. Wait, the HA tag here is supposed to be at the N-terminus, so the DNA should start with the HA sequence followed by the GADD45G coding sequence. Let me see the provided DNA sequence initial part:

The given plus strand starts with ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA

Starting with ATG, which is the start codon (methionine), that makes sense. Then TACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAA... Let's translate the first few codons. 

First 30 nucleotides: ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA

Translating:

ATG = M

TAC = Y

CCA = P

TAT = Y

GAT = D

GTT = V

CCA = P

GAT = D

TAC = Y

GCC = A

AAA = K

Putting that together: M Y P Y D V P D Y A K

Wait, the HA tag is normally YPYDVPDYA. So the sequence here after the start codon should code for the HA tag. Let me check. The HA tag's amino acid sequence is Tyr-Pro-Tyr-Asp-Val-Pro-Asp-Tyr-Ala (YPYDVPDYA) or similar. Let me see how this encodes here. The first codons after ATG (M) are TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), GAT (D), GTT (V), CCA (P), GAT (D), TAC (Y), GCC (A)... That gives the sequence Y P Y D V P D Y A... So that matches the HA tag YPYDVPDYA (though the full HA tag might be longer, but assuming that's the one used here). The start Met is followed by the HA tag. So this part looks correct.

Next, after the HA tag should be the GADD45G coding sequence. The researcher wants a recombinant protein with HA tag at the N-terminus. So the construct is HA followed by GADD45G. Let's make sure that there's no frame shift here. Checking the HA tag sequence in the DNA. The HA sequence in DNA would be: TAC (Y) is the first codon after ATG. Wait, no—the ATG is the start codon, then the HA tag. Wait the HA tag here is encoded correctly because the nucleotides after ATG are TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA. That corresponds to Y P Y D V P D Y A K. So, starting with Met and then the HA tag. So the HA tag is in frame with the start codon, so the tag is added properly. After the HA tag, the GADD45G coding sequence starts.

But the problem arises when they can't overexpress the protein. Possible issues: the promoter isn't functional, the antibiotic resistance isn't working, but since they selected antibiotic-resistant colonies, the plasmid must have been transfected. Maybe the promoter is not strong enough, but they expected overexpression. Maybe the construct has an error that causes no protein expression.

But the problem mentions that they looked at the plus strand sequence of the construct and realized the reason. So it's likely a problem with the construct's sequence, like a mutation, frame shift, or missing elements. Let's look further.

Assuming the HA tag is correctly inserted, then the rest should be GADD45G. But if there's a problem in the sequence that prevents expression. Let me see. The start codon is present. Then HA tag in frame. So after the HA tag, the sequence should be in frame with GADD45G. Is there a possible premature stop codon in the HA-GADD45G fusion?

Alternatively, perhaps the Kozak sequence is missing. The Kozak sequence is important for efficient translation initiation in mammalian cells. The Kozak consensus is CCRCCAUGG, where AUG is the start codon. The ATG in the construct is preceded by what? Let's check the nucleotides before the start codon. Wait, the provided sequence is the plus strand of the construct, which starts with ATG, so there's no sequence before that. If the construct starts with the coding sequence immediately, maybe lacking a proper Kozak sequence could reduce translation efficiency, but maybe they included that. Alternatively, maybe there's an internal ribosome entry site or a promoter, but that wasn't mentioned.

Another possibility is that during cloning, an error was introduced in the coding sequence that creates a premature stop codon. For example, if the HA tag insertion caused a frame shift. Wait, in the initial codons, HA is in frame: Y P Y D V P D Y A K...

Looking at the DNA sequence again: after the HA tag, what comes next? Let's look further into the DNA. The HA tag would go up to, say, AAA (K), then continues. Let me check the protein sequence. Suppose after the HA tag is the start of GADD45G.

Alternatively, maybe they inserted the HA tag in such a way that the GADD45G coding sequence is out of frame. Let's check for frame shifts. If the HA tag is inserted with the correct reading frame, then the GADD45G coding should follow in the same frame.

But in the sequence provided, after the HA tag's part (say until AAA), let's consider whether the joint between the HA and GADD45G is in frame. Let me see:

HA tag: Y P Y D V P D Y A K (should the HA tag end here? Usually the HA tag is about 9-10 amino acids). Then the K (AAA) is followed by ATGACTCTGG (nucleotides). Wait, the original HA tag ends at AAA, which is part of the HA tag (maybe). Let's see:

Original HA tag encoded by the DNA up to where: Let's count.

From the start:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA
M  Y   P   Y   D   V   P   D   Y   A   K

So that's 11 amino acids in the HA tag (or longer), depending on design. Then after AAA comes ATGACTCTGG... which is the next codon. The next codon after AAA (K) is ATG (M), which could be the start of the GADD45G protein. Wait, but the HA tag is at the N-terminus followed by GADD45G. However, if there is an ATG (start codon) after the HA tag, that would initiate a new translation, but since it's in the same reading frame, that ATG is actually in the same frame as the initial Met. Wait, the first start codon is ATG, followed by HA tag, then another ATG later. If the HA tag is followed by a Met in the same frame, that would imply that the initial Met fuses into HA tag, and then there's another Met later. However, unless there's a frameshift, the second ATG may be in a different reading frame. Wait, let's check. Suppose the HA tag is in frame 1 (since the start codon is ATG), and the subsequent sequence is in frame 1. The next ATG would start at position... Let's see, the HA tag as given starts at ATG (position 1), then TAC (pos4), CCA (pos7), etc. Each codon is 3nt. So after the first K (AAA) which is positions 28-30, the next codon starts at 31: ATG (31-33) which is met again. But if the frame is maintained, then that would be an in-frame Met. But then that would result in a Met at that position. But the GADD45G protein doesn't start with a Met; its natural start codon is the first one. Therefore, if there's an internal Met, the translation might start at the later ATG, leading to a truncated protein, but the first ATG is still the intended start. However, in mammalian cells, the ribosome typically initiates at the first AUG in the mRNA, so unless there's a leaky scanning, the first ATG should be used, so even if there's a second in-frame ATG, the protein would include both. But why would there be an internal Met? Looking at the provided DNA sequence:

After the initial HA tag, if GADD45G follows, then the natural coding sequence of GADD45G (without the HA tag) should start with its own ATG. But in this construct, the HA tag is added before GADD45G. Thus, the GADD45G coding sequence after the HA tag should be without its own start codon, just fused in-frame. If the researcher instead included the GADD45G's ATG again, that would create an internal Met. Let me check in the DNA sequence.

After the HA tag's coding sequence: The first part was up to AAA (K), which is the 10th amino acid (since the initial Met is 1). Then the DNA continues: ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA GTC CGC... so the next codons after AAA are ATG ACT CTG... which is Met Thr Leu Glu Glu Val Arg... So if the HA tag is already in frame, then this Met would be part of the coding sequence, possibly as part of GADD45G. But, the GADD45G native sequence doesn't start with Met-Thr-Leu..., right? The native GADD45G starts with Met, followed by...?

Wait, to check, we need the original GADD45G protein sequence. But since this isn't provided, maybe the error is that the HA tag was inserted in such a way that the GADD45G coding region is out of frame. Alternatively, when inserting the HA tag, the cloning caused a frameshift, leading to a premature stop codon. Let's check the provided DNA sequence for stop codons in all three frames.

Starting from the first ATG (frame 1), translate the entire sequence and check for stop codons. Since the problem says they notice the reason upon seeing the sequence, perhaps the construct has a premature stop codon inserted.

Alternatively, maybe the HA tag is inserted with a wrong frame, so after the HA tag, the GADD45G sequence is in another frame, resulting in a different amino acid sequence until a stop codon is encountered.

Let's process the entire sequence:

Start translating in frame starting from ATG, and continue until we see a stop codon. The sequence is long, but perhaps there's a stop codon early on.

The construct's plus strand starts at ATG (position 1). Let's translate. Take the first parts:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA CTC TGG...

Wait, wait. The entire DNA sequence as provided (I'll copy the first part again):

Start: 5' ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA 3'

Let me translate a portion. Let's split into triplets.

Starting with ATG (M), TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), GAT (D), GTT (V), CCA (P), GAT (D), TAC (Y), GCC (A), AAA (K), TGA (stop), CTC (L), TGG (W), AAG (K), etc.

Wait, hold on!!! The 13th codon (positions 31-33) is TGA, which is a stop codon. If that's the case, then after the 12th amino acid (K), there is a stop codon. So the construct has an in-frame stop codon after the HA tag. Therefore, the protein is terminated prematurely. So the HA tag is followed by a stop codon, and the translation stops, resulting in a very short protein (HA tag plus a few amino acids, then stop) which would not produce the full-length GADD45G, explaining no overexpression of the expected protein.

But how does that TGA arise? Let me check:

Positions 1-3: ATG

4-6: TAC

7-9: CCA

...

After AAA (positions 28-30): comes position 31-33: ATG (for K?), wait no. Wait the sequence after the HA part:

The first parts are:

Extract starting from the beginning (positions):

1-3: ATG (M)

4-6: TAC (Y)

7-9: CCA (P)

10-12: TAC (Y)

13-15: GAT (D)

16-18: GTT (V)

19-21: CCA (P)

22-24: GAT (D)

25-27: TAC (Y)

28-30: GCC (A)

31-33: AAA (K)

Wait, hold on, position 28-30: AAA, and then positions 31-33 are ATG. Wait wait the original posted sequence actually says:

Looking at the original sequence as given:

After start: ... AAA T G A C T C T G G ... Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me input the actual sequence accurately:

The user provided sequence starting from 5':

The full sequence is:

5'ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACA...3'

Wait, after the initial sequence "ATG TACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAA..." let's parse step by step:

Breaking into parts for better clarity:

Start:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA T G A C T C T G G A A G AAGTC CGC GGC CAG GAC ACA GTT CGG...

Wait, the portion after AAA is: ATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGC...

So it's AAA (positions 28-30) followed by TGA (positions 31-33: T G A). Then CTC (positions 34-36), TGG (37-39: W), and so on.

So at positions 31-33: TGA, which is a stop codon (translates to *). Then the rest of the sequence would be after that.

Thus, the coding sequence after the HA tag contains a TGA stop codon. That explains why the protein isn't expressed: translation stops after the HA tag. So the HA tag is part of the N-terminus, followed immediately by a stop codon. Therefore, the protein produced is just the HA tag plus a few amino acids, not the full-length GADD45G.

But why is there a TGA there? Let's check the original intention. The HA tag is added, and then the GADD45G coding sequence should follow. If there's an in-frame stop codon after the HA, this was likely an error in cloning. For example, perhaps during the cloning process, the GADD45G sequence was inserted in the wrong reading frame relative to the HA tag, leading to a frameshift. Alternatively, the HA tag was correctly inserted in frame but the subsequent GADD45G sequence had an error introducing the stop codon.

Wait, in the HA tag part: The HA tag normally is YPYDVPDYAG (or similar), encoded by TATCCATATGATGTACCAGATTACGC. In their construct, the sequence after ATG is
