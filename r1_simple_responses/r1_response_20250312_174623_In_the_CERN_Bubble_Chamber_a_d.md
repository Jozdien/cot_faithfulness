# R1 response

To determine the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of the particle \(X^0\) in the CERN Bubble Chamber, we need to calculate the decay length and relate it to the required resolution.

1. **Calculate the Lorentz factor (\(\gamma\))**:
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{E}{m} = \frac{27 \, \text{GeV}}{3.41 \, \text{GeV}} \approx 7.917
   \]

2. **Calculate the momentum (\(p\))**:
   \[
   p = \sqrt{E^2 - m^2} = \sqrt{27^2 - 3.41^2} \approx \sqrt{717.3719} \approx 26.784 \, \text{GeV}
   \]

3. **Calculate the velocity factor (\(\beta\))**:
   \[
   \beta = \frac{p}{E} = \frac{26.784}{27} \approx 0.992
   \]

4. **Calculate the average decay length (\(L_{\text{avg}}\))** in the lab frame:
   \[
   L_{\text{avg}} = \beta \gamma c \tau_0
   \]
   where \(\tau_0 = 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s}\) and \(c \approx 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\):
   \[
   L_{\text{avg}} \approx 0.992 \times 7.917 \times 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \times 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s} \approx 1.885 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \approx 1.885 \, \mu\text{m}
   \]

5. **Determine the resolution (\(\sigma\)) needed to observe 30% of the decays**:
   The probability that a decay occurs at a distance greater than \(\sigma\) is given by:
   \[
   P(L > \sigma) = e^{-\sigma / L_{\text{avg}}}
   \]
   Setting \(P(L > \sigma) = 0.3\):
   \[
   0.3 = e^{-\sigma / L_{\text{avg}}} \implies \ln(0.3) = -\frac{\sigma}{L_{\text{avg}}} \implies \sigma = -\ln(0.3) \times L_{\text{avg}}
   \]
   \[
   \sigma \approx 1.20397 \times 1.885 \, \mu\text{m} \approx 2.27 \, \mu\text{m}
   \]

Thus, the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays is \(\boxed{2.3 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}}\).

# R1 reasoning

Okay, so, I need to figure out the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of the decays of this particle X^0. The problem states that the proper lifetime of X^0 is τ₀ = 8 × 10⁻¹⁶ seconds. It also mentions that the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X^0 is 3.41 GeV. Hmm, let's see. 

First, I recall that the actual lifetime observed in the lab frame will be longer due to time dilation from special relativity. The particle is moving at relativistic speeds, so its lifetime in the lab frame (τ) should be gamma (γ) multiplied by the proper lifetime τ₀. So, τ = γτ₀. Therefore, the particle will travel a distance of vτ before decaying, where v is its velocity. The problem is asking for the spatial resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. So, maybe the resolution needs to be smaller than or equal to the average decay length to resolve 30% of them? Hmm, not entirely sure, but let's try to break it down step by step.

First, calculate gamma. Gamma is given by γ = E / m, where E is the total energy and m is the rest mass. The problem states the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X^0 is 3.41 GeV. Wait, so are those GeV in units where c=1? I think so, because in particle physics, energy and mass are often given in units where c=1. So, the total energy E is 27 GeV, and the rest mass m is 3.41 GeV.

So, gamma γ = E / m = 27 / 3.41 ≈ let's compute that. 27 divided by 3.41. 3.41 times 7 is about 23.87, which is less than 27. 3.41 * 7.8 = let's see, 3.41*7 = 23.87, 3.41*0.8=2.728, so total 23.87 + 2.728 ≈ 26.6. So 3.41*7.8 ~26.6. So 27 is 0.4 more. So 7.8 + 0.4/3.41 ≈ 7.8 + 0.117 ≈ 7.917. So γ ≈ 7.917. Let me use a calculator to be precise. 27 divided by 3.41. Yeah, let's compute it accurately.

27 ÷ 3.41 ≈ Let's compute 3.41 * 7 = 23.87

27 - 23.87 = 3.13

3.13 / 3.41 ≈ 0.917

So γ ≈ 7.917, as before.

So γ ≈ 7.917.

So, τ (lab frame lifetime) = γ * τ₀ = 7.917 * 8 × 10⁻¹⁶ s ≈ 63.336 × 10⁻¹⁶ s ≈ 6.3336 × 10⁻¹⁵ s.

Now, to find out how far the particle travels before decaying, we need to calculate the velocity v. Since in natural units (c=1), velocity v can be calculated from beta (β) where β = v/c, and γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²). But we have gamma. Alternatively, β can also be calculated using beta = p / E, where p is the momentum.

First, let's calculate the momentum p. For a relativistic particle, the relation between energy, momentum, and mass is E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². But since in natural units where c=1, it simplifies to E² = p² + m². Therefore, p = sqrt(E² - m²). 

Given that E = 27 GeV and m = 3.41 GeV, the momentum p is sqrt(27² - 3.41²). Let's compute that:

27² = 729

3.41² = 11.6281

So p = sqrt(729 - 11.6281) = sqrt(717.3719) ≈ 26.785 GeV/c. Because p is in GeV/c here, but since we're in natural units, p is in GeV/c but we can just take the numeric value as 26.785. 

Then β = p / E = 26.785 / 27 ≈ 0.992. So β ≈ 0.992.

But we should check the exact value. Let's do it more accurately:

p = sqrt(27^2 - 3.41^2) 

Compute 27^2 = 729. 

3.41^2: 3^2 = 9, 0.41^2 = 0.1681, and cross term 2*3*0.41 = 2.46, so (3 + 0.41)^2 = 9 + 2.46 + 0.1681 = 11.6281.

So p = sqrt(729 - 11.6281) = sqrt(717.3719). Now, sqrt(717.3719)

Well, sqrt(700) = 26.458, sqrt(729)=27, so sqrt(717.37) is about 26.78, as I said before. Let's confirm:

26.78^2 = (26 + 0.78)^2 = 26² + 2*26*0.78 + 0.78² = 676 + 40.56 + 0.6084 = 717.1684. That's close to 717.3719. Same with 26.78^2 ≈717.1684, so sqrt(717.3719) ≈ 26.78 + a little. Let's do linear approximation.

Let x = 26.78. x^2 = 717.1684. Difference needed: 717.3719 -717.1684=0.2035.

Derivative of x² is 2x= 53.56. So differential dx≈0.2035/53.56≈0.0038. So a better approximation would be 26.78 +0.0038≈26.7838. So p≈26.784 GeV/c. Rounded to four decimal places, 26.784.

Thus, beta = p/E ≈ 26.784 /27 ≈0.991. Let's compute 27*0.991=26.757, which is less than 26.784. So perhaps we need to recalculate.

Wait, no, beta = p/E = sqrt(E² - m²)/E. Wait, which becomes sqrt(1 - (m²/E²)).

Wait, another way, beta= sqrt(1 - (m²/E²)). So beta = sqrt(1 - (3.41² /27²)) = sqrt(1 - (11.6281 /729)) ≈ sqrt(1 - 0.01595) ≈ sqrt(0.98405) ≈0.992. Which matches.

So beta≈0.992, as estimated. So v≈0.992c.

Now, velocity is 0.992c. Multiply by gamma tau zero to get the decay length? Wait, decay length L is v gamma tau_0.

Wait, L= v * t (time in lab frame). But t is the average lifetime in lab frame, which is gamma tau_0 (since tau=gamma tau_0). Therefore, L= v gamma tau_0. So units: v is in meters per second, gamma is unitless, so L in meters.

Wait, but tau₀ is given in seconds. So yes:

L= v * gamma tau₀

But v=beta c, so L=beta c gamma tau₀

But for relativistic particles, gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta²) but we already know gamma from E/m, so it's easier to compute L= beta * gamma * c * tau₀.

Here, beta=0.992 which we can check. Alternatively, since gamma is approximately 7.917, and beta is approximately 0.992.

But to get precise value of beta*gamma:

since gamma ≈ E/m=27/3.41≈7.917.

so beta*gamma would be (p/E)*gamma = (p/m) * (m/E) * gamma= (p/m). Since p= sqrt(E² -m²)/c. Wait, no, in natural units where c=1, p= sqrt(E² -m²). Therefore, p in GeV/c here.

Wait, we can check:

beta= p / (E) = sqrt(E² -m²)/E

Multiply by gamma: beta*gamma = sqrt(E² -m²)/E * (E/m) = sqrt(E² -m²)/m

Which would just be (sqrt(E² - m²))/m

So, L= beta gamma c tau_0.

But with c in m/s and tau₀ in seconds.

Therefore, let's compute beta *gamma first.

Since L= beta gamma c tau₀.

From above, beta gamma = sqrt(E² -m²)/m

So sqrt(E² -m²)/m = sqrt((27)^2 - (3.41)^2)/3.41.

We already computed E² - m²= 717.3719 GeV²

Thus, sqrt(717.3719)/3.41≈26.784 /3.41≈ 7.853, because 3.41 *7=23.87, 3.41*7.853= approx 7.853 divided into 26.784: 26.784 ÷3.41

So same as 27/3.41 ≈7.917. Wait, wait. Hold on:

Wait, if L= beta gamma c tau₀, beta gamma = sqrt(E² -m²)/m ≈ (26.784)/3.41≈7.853

Thus, beta gamma ≈7.853

So L= beta gamma * c tau₀ ≈7.853 * c *8e-16 s.

But c ≈3e8 m/s.

So, L ≈7.853 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Multiply constants: 7.853 *3 *8 ≈7.853*24≈188.47 Thus, 188.47 *1e8 *1e-16=188.47 *1e-8 = 1.8847e-6 meters. Which is 1.8847 micrometers.

So L≈1.88 micrometers.

Wait, so the decay length is roughly 1.88 micrometers. Therefore, is the resolution needed to observe 30% of the decays related to this decay length?

Hmm, but how does the resolution relate to observing decays.

The idea is that when a particle decays, the detector must be able to resolve the decay vertex from the production vertex. If the resolution is too poor, you can't distinguish the decay as a separate vertex and maybe just see a single track or miss the decay products. So the spatial resolution sigma (the uncertainty in position measurement) has to be small enough such that a significant fraction of the decay lengths are larger than sigma. Then you can observe them.

But how does the percentage come into play? The problem says "observe at least 30% of the decays." So maybe the decay length distribution follows an exponential decay, and the probability that the decay happens at a distance greater than some L_min is exp(-L_min/(gamma beta c tau_0)). Wait, actually the decay probability distribution in terms of path length is (1/(gamma beta c tau_0)) exp(-L/(gamma beta c tau_0)).

So the probability that the decay happens at a distance >= x is the integral from x to infinity of that distribution, which is exp(-x/(gamma beta c tau_0))

So if you want P(L >=x ) = 0.3, then exp(-x/(L_avg)) = 0.3, where L_avg=gamma beta c tau0. Thus, to have 30% of the decays to occur beyond a length x, you need x such that x = -L_avg ln(0.3). Then, the required resolution would need to be at least x, so that x = resolution gives 30% of decays observed?

But perhaps, conversely, if your resolution is sigma, then you can only detect decays that occur at separation greater than sigma. So the probability that a decay is detectable is the probability that the decay length L > sigma, which is exp(-sigma / L_avg). Therefore, to have exp(-sigma / L_avg) >= 0.3.

So we want exp(-sigma / L_avg) =0.3=>sigma /L_avg= -ln(0.3). Therefore, sigma= - ln(0.3) L_avg.

Therefore, solving for sigma, which would be the resolution required. Thus, sigma= ln(10/3) * L_avg= ln(1/0.3)= 1.20397 in book.

Wait, computation: ln(0.3)= -1.20397, so -ln(0.3)=1.20397.

Therefore, sigma=1.20397*L_avg.

Therefore, the spatial resolution must be smaller than sigma=1.2... *L_avg. But that can't be, I think. Wait, because if the resolution is sigma, the uncertainty in the position measurement is sigma. To resolve two points separated by a distance d, the resolution must be d > sigma? Or is there a factor of sqrt(2}?

Wait, actually, the discernible distance depends on the uncertainty. If you have two points each with uncertainty sigma, then their separation must be on the order of the combined uncertainty. That is, if two points are separated by distance D, then to resolve them, D must be greater than some multiple of the resolution sigma. If the resolution is given as the standard deviation, then two points separated by D can be resolved at a certain confidence level if D/sigma is sufficiently large.

But detecting decays would require distinguishing the primary vertex (production point) from the secondary vertex (decay point). Each vertex has some uncertainty in its position. Let's say the position uncertainty (resolution) is sigma. Then, the separation between the primary and secondary vertex would need to be greater than some multiple of sigma to be observable.

Typically, in particle physics, in order to resolve two vertices separated by a distance L, the resolution sigma needs to satisfy L > const * sigma, where const is around 2 or so (depending on the confidence level). That is, if a decay occurs at L, and if you can measure both the position where the particle is produced and the position where it decays with an uncertainty of sigma each, then the total uncertainty in the separation distance is sqrt(sigma^2 + sigma^2)=sqrt(2) sigma. To have a 30% probability... Wait, maybe not. Maybe the problem is simpler than that.

The problem states "What minimum resolution is needed to observe at least 30% of the decays?" Well, perhaps we use the survival probability where P(L > sigma) = 30%. That is, the probability that the decay occurs after traveling a distance greater than the resolution is 30%, so they would observe that many decays. Therefore, set the cumulative distribution function for the decay length L being greater than sigma, P(L > sigma) = exp(-sigma / (gamma beta c tau0)) = 0.3.

Solving for sigma gives sigma = - (gamma beta c tau0) * ln(0.3). Wait, that would make sigma equal to 1.2 L_avg.

But wait, as per the exponential distribution, the average decay length L_avg is gamma beta c tau0, and

P(L > x) = exp(-x / L_avg). So set this equal to 0.3:

exp(-x / L_avg) =0.3

Take natural logarithm of both sides:

-x / L_avg = ln(0.3)

Multiply both sides by -L_avg:

x= -L_avg * ln(0.3)≈ -L_avg*(-1.20397)=1.20397 L_avg.

Thus, x≈1.204*L_avg.

So the length x such that 30% of the particles decay beyond x, so sigma must be at most x to observe those decays. Wait, but if the resolution is sigma, the distance between vertices must be greater than the resolution. So 3o% of decays would occur at a distance greater than 1.204*L_avg, but how is this linked to the resolution?

Wait this is perhaps a statistical problem. If the resolution is sigma, effectively, the minimal discernible decay length is on the order of sigma (I need to detect that the particle decayed at least at a distance sigma). Thus, the number of decays that produce a track longer than sigma (L>sigma) will be P=exp(-sigma /L_avg). To have P=0.3, so exp(-sigma /L_avg)=0.3. Then, sigma = - L_avg * ln 0.3. 

So the required resolution is sigma= -L_avg*ln(0.3). Because if your resolution is sigma, only decay lengths longer than sigma will be actually observed as decays, so you want 30% (lower) decay lengths longer than sigma.

Alternatively, maybe the person mean spatial resolution in the sense that a decay can be noticed as a kink or secondary vertex, so to resolve the fact that a decay has occurred, the decay length must be longer than the spatial resolution. Therefore, the fraction of observable decays is P(L>sigma).

Then solving P(L>sigma)=0.3 gives sigma= - L_avg * ln(0.3). So the proper Calculation:

Already calculated above decay length average L_avg≈1.88 micrometer.

Then sigma ≈1.88e-6 m *1.20397≈2.26e-6 meters≈2.26 micrometers.

So, the required resolution should be~2.26 micrometers.

But let's check:

Exactly,

L_avg= beta gamma c tau0 ≈ as above,

we have sigma = - ln(0.3) * L_avg≈1.20397 *1.88micrometers≈2.26 micrometers. So approximately 2.26 micrometers.

Is there a unit convention? Do they want the answer in meters, centimeters, millimeters, micrometers?

Alternatively, perhaps correct calculation will use exact numbers.

Wait, let's re-calculate all step-by-step.

Given:

Proper lifetime, tau0=8e-16s

Energy, E=27GeV

Rest Mass, m=3.41GeV

Compute gamma:gamma= E/m=27/3.41 ≈7.916

Compute beta:beta= sqrt(1 - (m^2/E^2))=sqrt(1 - (3.41^2/27^2))=sqrt(1 - (11.6281/729))≈sqrt(1 -0.01595)=sqrt(0.98405)≈0.992 (approximately 0.992)

Then, compute beta gamma, needed for decay length:L_avg= beta gamma c tau_0

Beta gamma= (sqrt(E^2 -m^2))/m= same as calculated before => sqrt(717.3719)/3.41≈26.784/3.41≈7.854.

So, precise L_avg= beta gamma c tau0= 7.854*(3e8 m/s)*(8e-16 s)

Compute that:

7.854 *3e8 *8e-16=7.854*24e-8=188.496e-8=1.88496e-6 meters≈1.885e-6 meters≈1.885 micrometers.

Calculate ln(0.3)= -1.203972804

Thus, sigma=1.203972804 (L_avg)=1.20397*1.885e-6≈ approx:

1.20397*1.885= Multiply 1.2*1.885≈2.262, 0.00397*1.885≈0.0075. So total≈2.262+0.0075≈2.2695. So 2.2695e-6 meters≈2.27 micrometers.

So, the required spatial resolution sigma≈2.27e-6 meters=2.27 micrometers.

Therefore, the answer should be about 2.3 micrometers. If needing in meters, 2.3e-6 meters, or 2.3 micrometers.

But perhaps rounding? Incase check calculation again.

But let me check all steps once again.

Error free?

First, Gamma=E/m=27/3.41≈7.916 ≈yep.

Beta=sqrt(1 – (m²/E²)) → sqrt(1 – (3.41² / 27²)).

Which is same as sqrt(1 – (11.6281 /729)) ~sqrt(1 –0.01595)=sqrt(0.98405).

Indeed sqrt(0.98405) is≈0.992, so he's right.

Beta gamma=beta * gamma= (sqrt(1 – m²/E²))*(E/m)= sqrt(E² –m²)/m. Which we calculated as≈26.784/3.41≈7.854, correct.

L_avg= beta gamma c tau0=7.854*3e8 m/s*8e-16s=1.885e-6 meters.

So this is correct.

Then, asked to compute required resolution sigma such that P(L > sigma)=0.3.

Which gives sigma= -L_avg*ln(0.30)=1.2039*1.885e-6=2.27e-6 m.

So 2.27 micrometers.

Hence, the answer should be \boxed{2.3 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}} or \boxed{2.3 \mu\text{m}}? Well, depending on format.

The problem says "minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays".

Yes, understood as, in order to see 30% of the decays, even if tracks closer than the resolution won't be detected. Hence, resolution needs to be better (i.e., smaller) so that sigma = 2.3 micrometers.

Wait, side note: perhaps, if we set sigma = L_avg, then the probability would be exp(-1)≈36.8%. So the problem wants exp(-sigma/L_avg)=30%, so sigma= ~1.2 L_avg.

Which leads sigma= 1.2 times 1.88=>2.26 micrometers≈2.3 micrometers.

Therefore, yeah, putting it all together.

Answer: minimum resolution required is approximately 2.3 micrometers.

**

**Final Answer**
The minimum resolution needed is \boxed{2.3 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}}.
