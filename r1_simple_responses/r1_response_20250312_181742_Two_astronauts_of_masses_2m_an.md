# R1 response

To find the relative speed and the total energy of the system of two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, we start by considering their velocities and masses in the Earth frame. 

### Relative Speed
The astronauts are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c in the same direction. To find the relative speed of one astronaut as observed from the other's rest frame, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula:
\[
u' = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]
where \(u = 0.6c\) (velocity of the first astronaut) and \(v = 0.5c\) (velocity of the second astronaut). Plugging in the values:
\[
u' = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} = \frac{c}{7}
\]
Thus, the relative speed is \(\boxed{\dfrac{c}{7}}\).

### Total Energy
The total energy of the system in the Earth frame is the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut. The relativistic energy is given by \(E = \gamma m c^2\), where \(\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\).

For the first astronaut (mass \(2m\), velocity \(0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{5}{4}
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 \cdot 2m c^2 = \frac{5}{4} \cdot 2m c^2 = \frac{5}{2} m c^2
\]

For the second astronaut (mass \(3m\), velocity \(0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 \cdot 3m c^2 = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \cdot 3m c^2 = 2\sqrt{3} m c^2
\]

Adding these energies together gives the total energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = \frac{5}{2} m c^2 + 2\sqrt{3} m c^2
\]
Thus, the total energy is \(\boxed{\left( \dfrac{5}{2} + 2\sqrt{3} \right) m c^2}\).

# R1 reasoning

Okay, so I need to find the relative speed and the total energy of a system with two astronauts. Their masses are 2m and 3m, and they're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c in the same direction. Hmm, let me start by recalling how relativity works here. 

First, the relative speed. In classical mechanics, if two objects are moving in the same direction, the relative speed is just the difference between their speeds. So 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. But wait, this is relativistic, so maybe the formula is different? Because in relativity, velocities don't simply add up linearly. There's the velocity addition formula. Hmm. But here the problem mentions relative speed. Wait, actually, if both astronauts are moving in the same direction according to the same frame, then their relative speed as measured in that frame would still be the difference, right? Because in the rest frame, observer will just see one moving faster than the other by 0.1c. But in that case, why would relativity matter for the relative speed? Wait, but maybe they are asking for the speed of one astronaut as seen from the other astronaut's rest frame. The question says "relative speed", which can sometimes mean the speed of one relative to the other. That would require using the relativistic velocity addition formula. So I need to double-check that. 

In the Earth frame (assuming the given speeds are with respect to Earth), Astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and Astronaut B at 0.5c. To find the speed of A as seen from B's frame, we can use the formula for relative velocity in special relativity. The formula is (u - v)/(1 - uv/c²), where u is the velocity of A in the Earth frame and v is the velocity of B's frame (which is moving at 0.5c relative to Earth). Wait, so is that the correct approach? Let me recall. If we have two frames, S and S', moving at velocity v relative to each other, then the velocity of an object in S' frame is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²).

Yes, that's correct. So here, we can take S as the Earth frame, S' as B's rest frame (moving at 0.5c relative to Earth). Then, Astronaut A's speed in Earth's frame is 0.6c, so in B's frame it would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c² ) = (0.1c)/(1 - 0.3) = 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c. So approx 0.1428c. Which is around 1/7th the speed of light. So the relative speed would be approximately 0.1428c. But not too sure. Maybe the problem is expecting classical relative velocity, but given the mention of relativistic speeds, we should use the relativistic formula. 

But let me think again. The problem says "relative speed". If you are asked for the relative speed between two objects moving at 0.6c and 0.5c in the same direction, then from Earth's perspective, their relative speed is 0.1c, but otherwise, if from one of the astronauts' frame, then different. But let's check exact question wording: "What will be the relative speed and the total energy of the system?". The term "relative speed" can be ambiguous here. 

In the context of physics, if not specified, it might mean the speed of one object as observed from the other's rest frame. But perhaps the problem expects the Earth frame relative speed, which is 0.1c, but in that case, since they are traveling relativistically, is there a "relativistic relative speed"? Wait, no. In a given frame, two velocities are just subtracted, so 0.1c. But the concept of relative velocity as between the two objects, which in special relativity would involve a Lorentz transformation. So probably the answer is either 0.1428c (1/7c), or 0.1c.

But probably 0.1c if the question is being asked from Earth frame. Wait, but in the problem statement. Wait, the problem says: "What will be the relative speed and the total energy of the system?". It doesn't specify in which frame. Oh! Total energy would depend on the frame. Hmm, so if the problem mentions total energy of the system, it's the sum of the kinetic energies plus rest energies. But Energy is frame-dependent. So considering the problem says "the total energy of the system", we need to specify in which frame. However, the problem does not specify the frame. So this is ambiguous. 

Wait the velocities are given "in the positive x-direction", so probably in Earth's frame. Otherwise, if you need to compute total energy, it depends on the frame. If not specified, the simplest is Earth's frame. But in that case, then total energy would be the sum of each astronaut's total energy (kinetic plus rest) in Earth's frame. But relativistic energy is given by gamma times m c squared. Therefore, for each astronaut: energy is gamma * m_rest * c². But here, the masses are 2m and 3m. Wait, did they say masses as 2m and 3m, but are those rest masses? Yes, in relativity, masses given are rest masses. So astronaut 1 has rest mass 2m, astronaut 2 rest mass 3m. Therefore, their total energies in Earth's frame would be gamma1 * 2m c² + gamma2 * 3m c².

So then energy would be:

For the first astronaut, moving at 0.6c: gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - 0.6²) which is 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy E1 = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut at 0.5c: gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. Hence E2 = 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.4641 m c².

Total energy would be 2.5 + 3.4641 ≈ 5.9641 m c². So approx 6.0 m c².

But let me compute exact values. Hmm. 

First, for gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.6²) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 5/4 = 1.25. Correct. So E1 = 2m c² * 5/4 = 10m c² / 4 = 2.5 m c². Okay.

Gamma2: 0.5c. So velocity squared over c squared is 0.25. So 1 - 0.25 = 0.75. sqrt(0.75) is sqrt(3)/2. Therefore 1 / sqrt(0.75) is 2 / sqrt(3) ≈ 1.1547. Then E2 = 3 m c² * 2 / sqrt(3) }.

Hold on. Let's compute 3 * 2 / sqrt(3) = 6 / sqrt(3) = 2 sqrt(3). Because 6 / sqrt(3) = 6 sqrt(3) / 3 = 2 sqrt(3). So for E2, 2 sqrt(3) ≈ 2 * 1.732 ≈ 3.464 m c². Yes, as above. So total energy is 2.5 m c² + 3.464 m c² ≈ 5.964 m c². So we can write it as (5/2 + 2 sqrt(3)) m c², if exact expression is needed.

So exact total energy is 2*(5/4) m c² + 3*(2/sqrt(3)) m c²? Wait, no. Wait, E1 is gamma1 * m_rest1 * c², which is (5/4) * 2m c² = 5/2 m c², which is 2.5. Hmm. For E2, gamma2 * m_rest2 * c², which is gamma2 *3m c^2. And gamma2 is 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.5²) = 1 / (sqrt(3)/2) ) = 2/sqrt(3) ≈ 1.1547. Therefore, 2/sqrt(3) * 3m c² = 6/sqrt(3) m c² = 2*sqrt(3) m c squared ≈ 3.464 m c².

Thus total energy is 5/2 m c^2 + 2 sqrt(3) m c^2. If we keep in exact terms, that's equal to (5/2 + 2 sqrt(3)) m c² ≈ 5.964 m c². So if they want an exact value, we can write 5/2 + 2 sqrt{3} all multiplied by m c².

And in terms of relative speed, if they are wanting the relative speed in Earth frame, that would be just 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c, so v_rel = 0.1 c.

But as I thought earlier, though, the problem might be wanting the speed of one in the rest frame of the other, which uses the velocity addition formula. So in that case, user wants us to compute using the formula:

u' = (u - v) / (1 - uv/c² )

Let’s check with astronaut A (0.6c) from astronaut B's frame (who is moving at 0.5c). Then according to the formula, plugging into:

u’_A = (u - v) / (1 - (u v)/c² )

= (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c)(0.5c)/c² )

= 0.1c / (1 - 0.3 )

= 0.1c / 0.7 = 0.1 / 0.7 c ≈ 0.142857c ≈ (1/7) c which is ≈ 0.14286c. 

So, if the question wants the relative speed between the two astronauts, it's either 0.1c in Earth frame or 0.14286c in one's rest frame. But in the problem statement, They specified "the relative speed and the total energy of the system". Hmmm, given that, but question isn't clear.

Wait, actually, definitions: "Relative speed" between two objects in SR in different frames can differ, so in which frame is the relative speed being asked? If relative speed is the speed of one with respect to the other, then that is frame dependent. However, in the Earth frame, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B is moving at 0.5c, so in Earth frame, their closing speed is 0.1c? But in reality, they are moving in the same direction, so it's called the relative speed—it would be 0.1c. In that case, 0.1c is correct. But when one reports the speed of astronaut A in the rest frame of astronaut B, that is different (0.14285c approx.), perhaps. So I need to check terminology.

Wait, in Newtonian mechanics, relative speed when moving in the same direction, subtract. Special relativity: relative speed isn't the same. So probably, to get the "correct relative speed", one needs to use the velocity addition formula. So pre-relativistically, you'd subtract. But relativistically, it is (u - v)/(1 - uv/c²). So perhaps the answer expected here would be 0.1c / (1 - 0.3) = 0.1c / 0.7 = 1/7 c ≈0.14286c.

But standard terminology, is the relative velocity different based on frame? Since the question does not specify, but since it's a relativistic problem, they might want the correct formula, not the classical.

Alternatively (worst case): the problem says, astronauts move at relativistic speeds and question says "the relative speed", so maybe that's a trick to apply relativistic addition. Perhaps instructors often contrast the two. So possibilities:

If you naively subtract, 0.1c, but the correct relativistic relative speed is approximately 0.143c. So that needs (u -v)/(1 - uv/c²). So answer for relative speed is 0.1c / (1 - 0.3) = 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.14286c. Which is exact 1/7c. Because 0.1 / 0.7 = 1/7. Think about fractions.

Wait 0.1 c ÷ 0.7 is the same as (1/10)/(7/10) = 1/7. So yes, it's exactly (1/7)c. Huh, that's correct. So it's exactly c/7 ≈0.14286c. So exact answer. Converting 0.1c / (0.7) gives 1/7. So precision energy in terms of fractions and radicals. 

Thus the exact expressions for the answers could be:

Relative speed : c/7 ≈0.14286c

Total energy: (5/2 + 2 sqrt{3}) m c². How much is 5/2 + 2 sqrt(3)?

Since 5/2 = 2.5, and 2 sqrt{3}≈3.464 , so sum≈5.964 m c²≈6.0 m c². But need exact answer.

Alternatively, for total energy, is there a way to express that more simply? Let's check.

5/2 is 5/2. 2 sqrt{3} can be written as 2√3, so together 5/2 + 2√3. Alternatively, common denominator? Not really. So, maybe you can combine them?

Wait, m c² (5/2 + 2√3). Is that multiplicative? It can be written as [(5 + 4√3)/2] m c². So factor numerator and denominator. So (5 + 4√3)/2) m c².

Yes. So:

Total energy E = (5 + 4√3)/2 * m c².

But let me check:

5/2 is (5/2) m c², and 2 sqrt(3) m c². To add them over a common denominator, 5/2 + (2 sqrt(3)) is indeed 5/2 + (4 sqrt(3))/2 = (5 +4 sqrt(3))/2. So, same number. So that can be considered.

So, the exact answer would be relative speed: (1/7) c, and total energy: (5 +4√3)/2 m c². Let's multiply that out:

(5 +4√3)/2 = 5/2 + 2√3, which is the same as earlier.

So, conclusion:

Relative speed is c/7.

Total energy (5/2 +2√3) m c². Alternatively (5 +4√3)/2 m c squared.

So, therefore, the answers should be:

Relative speed: c/7

Total energy: (5/2 +2√3) m c².

Alternatively, if expressed numerically, approximately 0.1428c and 5.964 m c².

So, I need to confirm whether the problem expects symbolic or numerical.

But given that the problem uses symbols m and c, perhaps we leave them in terms of m and c. So relative speed is c/7, written as (1/7)c or c/7. Although, there's the exact expression of (0.1c)/(1 - 0.3) = 0.1c/0.7 = c/7, which works.

Wait, so 0.1 divided by 0.7 is same as 1/7. Therefore, yes, so exact answer is c/7. So how come 0.6c -0.5c =0.1c, and then divide by (1 - (0.6*0.5)), which is 1 -0.3=0.7, hence denominator 0.7. So yes, (0.6c -0.5c)/ (1 -0.3) =0.1c /0.7=1/7 c. So exactly c/7, which we can write as (1/7)c or c/7. So that is exact.

Therefore, relative speed is c/7.

Total energy is E1 + E2= (gamma1 *2m c^2) + (gamma2 *3m c^2). Gamma1 was 5/4, so (5/4 *2m c^2)= (5/2 m c^2). Gamma2 was 2/sqrt(3). (2/sqrt(3) *3m c^2)= 6/sqrt(3) m c^2= 2*sqrt(3)m c^2. So combined total energy is (5/2 +2 sqrt(3)) m c^2.

So this is the exact expression. Calculate 5/2 and 2 sqrt(3): 5/2=2.5; 2 sqrt(3)≈2*1.732≈3.464. Sum≈5.964. But we can just present the exact form, especially since the problem gives masses as 2m and 3m. So definitely keep in symbolic terms.

Alternatively, the problem might accept numbers. But ambiguous. Let's check the system:

They probably want:

Relative speed: c/7. Where the speed of one with respect to other is c/7.

Total energy: in Earth's frame, (5/2 +2√3) m c^2. Okay, this seems to check out.

Therefore, is there any reason to doubt?

Wait, when the problem mentions "total energy of the system", does that refer to just summing individual energies? Yes. In SR, in a particular frame, the total energy is just sum of the energies of all the particles. So yes, in Earth's frame, sum the energies calculated as gamma * rest mass energy. Hence yes, the energies we calculated are correct.

Therefore, the answers should be:

Relative speed: c/7, and total energy: (5/2 + 2√3) m c². 

In a box, the former is straightforward. The second one perhaps needs to check the exact expression. But perhaps written as (5 + 4√3)/2 m c², or, when rationalized.

Alternatively, leave as involves fractions and radicals, which is okay; So in LaTeX,

Relative speed: \boxed{\dfrac{c}{7}}.

Total energy: \boxed{\left( \dfrac{5}{2} + 2\sqrt{3} \right) m c^2}.

But seems correct.

Alternatively, check if my analysis made any mistake. First in the relative speed:

Velocity of astronaut A as seen from astronaut B. 

S frame: Earth. Astronaut B is moving at 0.5c. So S' (B's frame) is moving at 0.5c relative to Earth.

Using Lorentz velocity transform, velocity of A (which is 0.6c in Earth's frame) seen in B's frame is:

u’ = (u - v)/(1 - uv/c² )

= (0.6c -0.5c)/(1 -0.6*0.5 c²/c² )

= (0.1c)/(1 -0.3 )

= 0.1c /0.7. So 1/7 c. Final relative speed c/7. Yes. Correct.

That seems correct.

Total energy, recalling in Earth's frame:

gamma calculations. For 0.6c, 1/sqrt(1-0.36)=1/sqrt(0.64)=1.25.

1.25 * 2 m c²=2.5 m c².

For 0.5c:

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 -0.25) =1/sqrt(0.75)=2 /sqrt(3)≈1.1547. Multiply by 3m c²:3*(2 /sqrt(3)) m c²=6 /sqrt(3)=2 sqrt(3)≈3.464 m c². Then total 5.964 m c². Correct.

Therefore, that seems all right. So all steps check out.

**Final Answer**

The relative speed is \boxed{\dfrac{c}{7}} and the total energy of the system is \boxed{\left( \dfrac{5}{2} + 2\sqrt{3} \right) m c^2}.
