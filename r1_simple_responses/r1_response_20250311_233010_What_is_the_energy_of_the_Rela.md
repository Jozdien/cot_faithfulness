# R1 response

To find the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of the nucleus \( X \) (Li with 3 neutrons) is 0.96\( c \):

1. **Identify the nucleus and its rest mass**:
   - The nucleus is \(^6\)Li, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons.
   - The atomic mass of \(^6\)Li is 6.015122887 u.
   - Convert the atomic mass to energy using \( 1 \, \text{u} = 931.49410242 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \):
     \[
     m c^2 = 6.015122887 \, \text{u} \times 931.49410242 \, \text{MeV}/\text{u} = 5603.0514537 \, \text{MeV}
     \]

2. **Calculate the Lorentz factor (\( \gamma \))**:
   - Given \( v = 0.96c \):
     \[
     \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714285714
     \]

3. **Compute the kinetic energy (K)**:
   - Using the formula \( K = (\gamma - 1) m c^2 \):
     \[
     K = (3.5714285714 - 1) \times 5603.0514537 \, \text{MeV}
     \]
   - Simplify \( \gamma - 1 \):
     \[
     \gamma - 1 = \frac{18}{7}
     \]
   - Calculate the kinetic energy:
     \[
     K = \frac{18}{7} \times 5603.0514537 \, \text{MeV} \approx 14407.8466 \, \text{MeV}
     \]

The energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus \( X \) is 0.96\( c \) is \(\boxed{14407.8466}\) MeV.

# R1 reasoning

Okay, so I need to find the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96 times the speed of light (c). The nucleus X is Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons. Hmm, let's start by figuring out what exactly the problem is asking for. 

First, I remember that in particle physics, when they talk about the energy of a collider, they're usually referring to the kinetic energy of the particles being accelerated, or sometimes the total energy. But given that the speed is given here, maybe I need to relate the relativistic kinetic energy to the speed. 

Lithium normally has an atomic number of 3, which means it has 3 protons. Since the nucleus is Li with 3 neutrons, it must be Lithium-6, right? Because the atomic number (protons) is 3, and adding 3 neutrons gives a mass number of 6. So the nuclide is ^6Li. 

The mass of a nucleus can be approximated by the sum of protons and neutrons times the atomic mass unit (u). Each proton is about 1.007276 u, and each neutron is about 1.008665 u. Wait, but sometimes people just use a rough value for the mass number when dealing with nuclei for simplicity, especially in problems where exact mass might not be critical. Let me check—if the problem is about relativistic energy, the exact mass might matter because energy scales with the rest mass. 

So for precision, perhaps they want me to use the actual rest mass of ^6Li? Let me think—in nuclear physics, the mass of a nucleus is typically less than the sum of its protons and neutrons due to binding energy. But maybe for this problem, since we're dealing with a high-energy collision and perhaps the binding energy is negligible compared to the kinetic energy, we can approximate the rest mass as the sum of protons and neutrons? Or maybe we need to use isotopic masses. 

Wait, since the problem mentions precision to 1e-4, it's important to get accurate masses here. So I need to look up the exact mass of ^6Li. Alternatively, maybe the question expects me to use standard atomic masses. Let me recall: Lithium-6 has a mass of approximately 6.015122 u. Let me verify. A quick check in my memory: the atomic mass of ^6Li is around 6.015 amu. Ok, for the purpose of solving this problem, perhaps using 6.015122 u. Let me note that 1 u is approximately 931.494 MeV/c². Therefore, the rest mass energy of ^6Li would be 6.015122 u * 931.494 MeV/u. 

Calculating that: 6 * 931.494 is about 5588.964 MeV, and 0.015122 * 931.494 ≈ 14.09 MeV. So total rest mass energy is roughly 5588.964 + 14.09 ≈ 5603.05 MeV. Let me check with more precise calculation:

6.015122 * 931.494:

First compute 6 * 931.494 = 5588.964

Then 0.015122 * 931.494: 

0.01 * 931.494 = 9.31494

0.005122 * 931.494 ≈ 4.770 (since 0.005 * 931.494 = 4.65747, and 0.000122*931.494≈0.1136 )

Adding those: 9.31494 + 4.65747 + 0.1136 ≈ 14.08501

Total rest mass energy: 5588.964 + 14.08501 ≈ 5603.049 MeV, so around 5603.05 MeV/c². 

So the rest mass m = 6.015122 u = 5603.05 MeV/c². Hmm. 

But I need to make sure about the exact value here. Let me cross-verify. The atomic mass of ^6Li is indeed 6.015122 u as per standard data tables. So that's safe. 

Now, the problem states that the speed v = 0.96c. I need to compute the total energy or kinetic energy. Wait, the RHIC energy is typically given per nucleus in the center-of-mass frame? Or in the lab frame? Wait, the question is about the energy of the collider such that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. So in the lab frame, each nucleus is moving at 0.96c. So perhaps they are asking for the kinetic energy per nucleus required to accelerate them to 0.96c. 

But I need to confirm whether it's the kinetic energy or the total energy. Generally, collider energies are often quoted as kinetic energy, but sometimes as total energy. But the question just says "the energy of the RHIC". Maybe we need to compute the kinetic energy required for each nucleus to reach 0.96c. 

So using relativistic equations. The kinetic energy (K) is given by:

K = (γ - 1) m c²

Where γ is the Lorentz factor, 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). 

Given v = 0.96c. Therefore, γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) 

Calculating that: 

First compute (0.96)^2 = 0.9216

1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784

Square root of 0.0784 is approx 0.28, since 0.28^2 = 0.0784. Therefore, γ ≈ 1/0.28 ≈ 3.5714. Let's check:

0.28 * 3.5714 ≈ 1.0. 

So, exactly, sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28, so yes, γ = 1/0.28 ≈ 3.57142857. 

Thus, γ ≈ 3.5714. 

So then, K = (3.5714 - 1) * m c² ≈ 2.5714 * 5603.05 MeV ≈ 

Calculating that:

2.5714 * 5000 = 12,857 MeV

2.5714 * 603.05 ≈ 2.5714 * 600 = 1,542.84; 2.5714 * 3.05 ≈ 7.84. So total ≈ 1,542.84 + 7.84 ≈ 1,550.68

Adding to the previous, total K ≈ 12,857 + 1,550.68 ≈ 14,407.68 MeV ≈ 14,407.7 MeV. 

But let's perform the exact multiplication:

3.5714 - 1 = 2.5714

m c² = 5603.05 MeV

K = 2.5714 * 5603.05

First, 2 * 5603.05 = 11,206.1

0.5 * 5603.05 = 2,801.525

0.0714 * 5603.05 ≈ Let's compute 5603.05 * 0.07 = 392.2135

5603.05 * 0.0014 ≈ 7.844.27

Wait, 0.0014 times 5603.05: 0.001 * 5603.05 = 5.60305; 0.0004 * 5603.05 = 2.24122; sum is 5.60305 + 2.24122 ≈ 7.84427

Therefore, 0.07 * 5603.05 ≈ 392.2135 + 7.84427 ≈ 400.0578

Thus, 0.5714 * 5603.05 = 0.5*5603.05 + 0.0714*5603.05 ≈ 2,801.525 + 400.0578 ≈ 3,201.5828

Wait, actually, I messed up the decimal: 0.5714 is 0.5 + 0.0714. So that's correct. So in total:

2 * 5603.05 = 11,206.1

0.5 * 5603.05 = 2,801.525

0.0714 * 5603.05 ≈ 400.0578

Wait, but when you say 2.5714, that's 2 + 0.5 + 0.0714. Wait, no: 2.5714 is 2 + 0.5714. So when we compute 2.5714 * 5603.05, it's 2*5603.05 + 0.5714*5603.05.

Which is 11,206.1 + (0.5*5603.05 + 0.0714*5603.05).

Wait, no. 0.5714 = 0.5 + 0.0714, right.

So 0.5714*5603.05 ≈ 2,801.525 + 400.0578 ≈ 3,201.5828

Hence, total Kinetic energy is 11,206.1 + 3,201.5828 ≈ 14,407.6828 MeV.

So approx 14,407.7 MeV. Let me check step by step:

First, compute γ - 1:

γ ≈ 3.5714, so γ - 1 = 2.5714

Then multiply by rest energy:

2.5714 * 5603.05

To compute 5603.05 * 2 = 11,206.1

5603.05 * 0.5 = 2,801.525

5603.05 * 0.0714 ≈ 5603.05 * 0.07 = 392.2135; 5603.05 * 0.0014 = ~7.844. Thus, total ≈ 392.2135 + 7.844 ≈ 400.0575.

Thus, total Kinetic energy is 11,206.1 + 2,801.525 + 400.0575 ≈ 14,407.6825 MeV.

So approximates to 14,407.68 MeV.

But is there a need for a more precise calculation?

Because the problem states the precision required is 1e-4, which is 0.0001, so 4 decimal places. Wait, but the numbers here—if we are to represent the energy in MeV with precision to 0.0001 (1e-4), but since the rest mass was given as 5603.05 MeV, which is already precise to 0.01 MeV. Hmm, seems conflicting. Perhaps the rest mass of ^6Li is known to higher precision. Let me confirm that.

Wait, the mass of ^6Li is actually known much more precisely. Let me check, for the atomic mass of ^6Li is 6.015122887 u exactly (from the NIST database). So maybe the value is 6.015122887 u. 

Converting that to MeV/c², we have 1 u = 931.49410242 MeV/c² (the exact value). Therefore:

6.015122887 u * 931.49410242 MeV/u = ?

Calculate this:

First, 6 * 931.49410242 = 5,588.9646145 MeV.

0.015122887 * 931.49410242:

Let me compute that step by step.

Compute 0.01 * 931.49410242 = 9.3149410242

0.005 * 931.49410242 = 4.6574705121

0.000122887 * 931.49410242 ≈ First, 0.0001 * 931.4941 = 0.09314941, then 0.000022887 * 931.4941 ≈ 0.0212783

So total ≈ 0.09314941 + 0.0212783 ≈ 0.1144277

So sum of 9.3149410242 + 4.6574705121 + 0.1144277 ≈ 14.08683924

Therefore, the total mass energy is approx 5,588.9646145 + 14.08683924 ≈ 5,603.0514537 MeV/c². 

So the exact rest mass energy is 5,603.0514537 MeV. Let me keep this more precise value for calculations.

So m c² = 5603.0514537 MeV. Then the Lorentz factor is exactly 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2).

Compute (0.96)^2: 0.9216

1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28 exactly, since 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784.

Therefore, γ = 1/0.28 ≈ 3.5714285714...

Therefore, kinetic energy K = (γ - 1) * m c² = (3.5714285714 - 1) * 5603.0514537 ≈ 2.5714285714 * 5603.0514537

Let me compute 2.5714285714 * 5603.0514537.

First, compute 2 * 5603.0514537 = 11,206.1029074

0.5714285714 * 5603.0514537

Since 0.5714285714 is 4/7 (since 0.571428... is 4/7). Check 4 divided by 7 ≈ 0.5714285714. Exactly, so 4/7.

So 0.5714285714 * 5603.0514537 = (4/7)*5603.0514537.

Compute 5603.0514537 / 7 = 800.435921957

Multiply by 4: 800.435921957 * 4 = 3,201.74368783

Therefore, total kinetic energy is 11,206.1029074 + 3,201.74368783 ≈ 14,407.8465952 MeV.

So approximately 14,407.8466 MeV. To convert this into a more presentable number with 1e-4 precision: 14,407.8466 MeV. So that would be 14,407.8466 MeV, but perhaps we need to round to four decimal places, making it 14,407.8466 ≈ 14,407.8466 MeV. But actually, in MeV, the 0.8466 is already ~0.85 of a MeV. So expressed with a precision of 1e-4 (i.e., 0.0001) would mean 14,407.8466 MeV.

But wait, can we check the factors once again?

Wait, 4 / 7 is approximately 0.5714285714, so multiplied by 5603.0514537:

But as previously, (5603.0514537 / 7 ) = 5603.0514537 ÷ 7.

Compute 5603.0514537 / 7:

5600 / 7 = 800. Therefore 7*800=5600.0000. 

3.0514537 remains. 3.0514537 / 7 ≈ 0.435921957

Hence total ≈ 800.435921957. Then 800.435921957 * 4 = 3,201.74368783 as before.

Adding to 11,206.1029074, we get 11,206.1029074 + 3,201.74368783 = 

11,206.1029074 + 3,201.74368783:

11,206 + 3,201 = 14,407.

0.1029074 + 0.74368783 = 0.84659523.

Thus, exactly 14,407.84659523 MeV.

So approximates to 14,407.8466 MeV.

But since the problem states that the precision is 1e-4, which is four decimal places. In this case, the exact value is 14,407.846595... which rounds to 14,407.8466 MeV. 

However, it's customary in such problems to give the kinetic energy per nucleon? Wait, but the problem just says "the energy of the RHIC", which is perhaps ambiguous. But given that nuclei are Lithium-6, with mass number 6, maybe the question wants the kinetic energy per nucleon?

Wait, but the RHIC accelerates nuclei to certain energies, which are often given in terms of the total energy per nucleus, or sometimes in terms of the center-of-mass energy per nucleon pair. The problem just says "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c". So perhaps they are asking for the kinetic energy of each nucleus. Since they specify velocity of the nucleus, not per nucleon.

Hence, sticking with the previous calculation, 14,407.8466 MeV per nucleus. But in accelerator physics, energy is sometimes quoted in GeV per nucleon. Wait, but RHIC typically uses gold nuclei, but in this case it's Lithium. So unsure, but since the problem mentions the nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons, the answer should be the total kinetic energy of each Lithium nucleus at 0.96c, which we just calculated as approximately 14,407.85 MeV, or 14.40785 GeV. 

But the problem says to give the precision to 1e-4, which would be in the units they ask for. Since 14,407.8466 MeV is 14,407.8466 MeV or 1.44078466 × 10^4 MeV. If precision is 1e-4 of the value, that would be 14,407.8 MeV with precision ± ~1.4 MeV. But the answer is precise already to 0.0001. Wait, maybe the user wants the answer in a certain unit. The problem says "the precision of the energy is at 1e-4".

What units are expected here? Let's check, because it's RHIC, which usually operates with energies in GeV per nucleon. Maybe the total kinetic energy is desired. But the problem says the precision is 1e-4, which, if the answer is 14407.8466 MeV, the precision is four decimal places. But in MeV, four decimal places would go to 0.0001 MeV, which is 100 eV precision. However, when the initial rest mass was calculated with precision up to 0.000001 MeV (since m c² was 5603.0514537 MeV), then γ is known exactly here since v is given exactly as 0.96c. Therefore, the calculation of K is (γ -1) * m c² with γ known exactly (since v is exact), so the precision comes from the rest mass.

But the problem states "the precision of the energy is at 1e-4." 1e-4 what? If in the energy unit, maybe 1e-4 in the same unit as the answer. For example, if the answer is 14,407.85 MeV, then precision is 1.440785e4 and given to 0.0001, which would require writing 14407.8466 ≈ 14407.8466 with four decimal places as 14407.8466. But MeV is a pretty large unit. Expressing MeV with four decimal places is 0.1 keV precision, which may be required.

Alternatively, maybe they expect TeV, GeV, or another unit. However, the calculated energy is ~14,408 MeV which is approximately 14.408 GeV. If the answer is expected in GeV, then 14.4078 GeV with four decimal places would be 14.4078 GeV (14.4078). But likely, given the usual convention, one would present the energy in GeV.

Wait, but let's consider that maybe the user wants rest mass in unified atomic mass units converted properly.

Wait, let's recapitulate the steps, in case I made an error. 

1. Identify the nucleus: ^6Li (3 protons, 3 neutrons), so mass number A=6.

2. Find the mass: 6.015122887 u.

3. Convert mass to energy: 6.015122887 u * 931.49410242 MeV/c²/u = 5603.0514537 MeV/c².

4. Calculate gamma for v=0.96c: γ = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.0784) = 1/0.28 ≈ 3.5714285714.

5. Kinetic energy K = (γ - 1) m c² ≈ 2.5714285714 * 5603.0514537 ≈ 14,407.8465952 MeV, or ~14,407.85 MeV.

So converting 14,407.85 MeV to GeV is 14.40785 GeV. However, when they specify precision 1e-4, perhaps expecting the answer in GeV with four decimal places. So that would be 14.4078 GeV.

But before wrapping up, let me check RHIC's actual parameters to verify if my approach aligns with reality. 

RHIC typically collides heavy ions like gold nuclei at energies like 100 GeV per nucleon. But that's for gold. For lighter ions like protons or lithium, the total energy would be lower. However, in this problem, it's merely a physics problem, not an actual real-world scenario. But the calculation seems correct. 

Alternatively, perhaps I was supposed to compute the kinetic energy in terms of MeV/u (per nucleon), which for Lithium-6 would be total K divided by 6. Then, K per nucleon would be 14,407.85 /6 ≈ 2,401.3076 MeV per nucleon, which is about 2.4013 GeV per nucleon. However, as the problem states the nucleus's speed is 0.96c, not per nucleon.

No, I think the answer they are expecting is the total kinetic energy of the nucleus, which is approximately 14,407.85 MeV, with the given precision of 1e-4. So the answer box should contain \\boxed{14407.8466} MeV or \\boxed{14.4078} GeV. But given RHIC energy is given in terms of GeV per nucleon usually, but perhaps the problem requires the answer in MeV. Let me double-check.

The problem says "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC)", so likely it wants the kinetic energy per nucleus. Since the rest mass is several GeV, the kinetic energy here would be about 14.4 GeV per nucleus. But perhaps they want the answer in MeV. Given the precision of 1e-4, which would be four decimal places as 14,407.8466 MeV, so that is accurate to 0.0001 MeV.

But in high-energy physics, using decimal places in MeV would be non-standard. They usually use GeV with decimals. 14,407.85 MeV is 14.40785 GeV. So if the answer is needed in GeV, 14.4079 GeV (rounded to four decimal places). If the answer is in MeV, 14407.8466 MeV. Given the problem says "precision of the energy is at 1e-4", if the energy is specified to 0.0001, whether it's GeV or MeV. Since the rest mass is in MeV, maybe they expect the answer in MeV. Therefore, boxed as 14407.8466 MeV. However, maybe they prefer the answer in GeV with four decimal places. But as per the calculation, performing it in MeV gives more decimal places. However, 14,407.8466 MeV is 1.44078466 × 10^4 MeV. The question says "precision at 1e-4", which usually refers to relative precision. Wait, 1e-4 is 0.01% precision. Wait no, 1e-4 as a decimal place is absolute.

Wait, the problem states the PS: "the precision of the energy is at 1e-4". Hmm, 1e-4 could be either relative or absolute. But typically, when asking for decimal precision, it's absolute. So if the energy is around 14,407 MeV, precision to 1e-4 would be 14,407.0000, but that's specifying four decimal places. However, in the context, if it's MeV, then four decimal places would be .8466, which is as above.

But when converting 0.8466 of a MeV, it can be written as 846.6 keV, but probably the answer is given in MeV with four decimal places. Thus, the boxed answer is \boxed{14407.8466} MeV. But perhaps correct to four decimal places irrespective of units. Wait, but the question doesn't specify the unit. That's another issue. Did it?

Wait, the original question: "What is the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c?" and "PS: the precision of the energy is at 1e-4."

Therefore, the problem doesn't specify the units. However, in high-energy physics, energies are typically given in electronvolts, so the standard would be either MeV or GeV. Since the rest mass was in the order of 5,000 MeV, the kinetic energy is 14,000 MeV, which is 14 GeV. But to avoid ambiguity, including units would be ideal, but maybe the problem expects the answer in MeV with four decimal places, thus the answer is 14407.8466 MeV, on the grounds that the rest mass was calculated in MeV and the precision requires four decimal places. Alternatively, one of the key steps that was made on there, let's check it once again.

Wait, the Lorentz factor calculation:

v = 0.96c, so:

β = v/c = 0.96

γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1 / sqrt(0.0784) = 1 / 0.28 = 3.5714285714...

Yes, so γ is exact, as it's 25/7, because 0.28 is 7/25. Therefore, sqrt(1 - β²) = 7/25? Wait, let's check:

No, 0.28 is 7/25 = 0.28. Because 7 divided by 25 is 0.28. Therefore, 1 - β² = (7/25)^2? Wait:

Wait, incorrect. Because sqrt(1 - β²) is 0.28. Therefore, 1 - β² = 0.28² = 0.0784. Which is indeed as we calculated earlier. So 1 - β² = 0.0784, then β = sqrt(1 - 0.0784) = sqrt(0.9216) = 0.96, yes. 

So given that, and m c² known precisely, then the Kinetic energy K is (γ - 1) m c² with γ = 25/7 (~3.5714285714). Therefore, (25/7 - 1) = 18/7.

Therefore, K = 18/7 * m c². Wait, let me check that.

Yes, γ - 1 = (1/sqrt(1 - β²) - 1) = 1/0.28 - 1 = (1 - 0.28)/0.28 = 0.72 / 0.28 = 18/7 ≈ 2.5714.

So in fractional form, γ - 1 = 18/7. Therefore, K is 18/7 * 5,603.0514537 MeV.

Compute 18/7 * 5,603.0514537:

First, divide 5,603.0514537 by 7 to get ~800.435921957 MeV.

Multiply by 18:

800.435921957 * 10 = 8,004.35921957

800.435921957 * 8 = 6,403.48737566

Total: 8,004.35921957 + 6,403.48737566 = 14,407.8465952 MeV.

So that's precise. Therefore, the exact energy is 18/7 * m c². But m c² is 6.015122887 u * 931.49410242 MeV/u ≈ 5603.0514537 MeV. 

Therefore, energy is (18/7)*5603.0514537 ≈ 14,407.8465952 MeV. Which is would round to 14,407.8466 MeV when needing 4 decimal places.

However, considering that in reality, velocities are sometimes calculated using beta gamma, but here velocity is given, so our approach is correct.

Therefore, the answer must be approximately 14,407.8466 MeV. 

Alternatively, since the problem gives the nucleus as Li with 3 neutrons. Maybe the user assumes that the mass is A times the atomic mass unit (u), approximating the nuclear mass as A u, neglecting the mass defect? Wait, sometimes in problems, for simplicity, the rest mass is approximated as A * u * c², because precise mass might not be given. But in this problem, given the PS mentions precision, needs careful calculation.

However, the user says "Knowing that X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons." Lithium normally has 3 protons, so ^6Li, which is 3 protons and 3 neutrons, and the correct isotopic mass is 6.015122... u. The problem is correctly solved with that mass.

But in case there is a different way. Suppose the problem is intending for us to assume that the mass is simply 6 * the atomic mass unit. But the atomic mass unit isn't exactly the mass of a proton or neutron, but 1 u is approximately the mass of a nucleon. Let me compute in that case.

Suppose we take m = 6 u.

1 u = 931.494 MeV/c². Therefore, m c² = 6 * 931.494 = 5,588.964 MeV.

Then, K = (γ - 1) m c² = (3.57142857 -1) * 5,588.964 ≈ 2.5714 * 5,588.964 = 

Similar as before:

2 * 5,588.964 = 11,177.928

0.5714 * 5,588.964 = (5,588.964 * 0.5) + (5,588.964 * 0.0714) 

5,588.964 * 0.5 = 2,794.482

5,588.964 * 0.0714 ≈ approx 5,588.964 * 0.07 = 391.227; 5,588.964 * 0.0014 ≈ 7.82455; total≈399.05155

So total 0.5714 * 5,588.964 ≈ 2,794.482 + 399.05155 ≈ 3,193.5335

Adding to 11,177.928 + 3,193.5335 ≈ 14,371.4615 MeV. 

Which is about 14,371.46 MeV, compared to our previous 14,407.85 MeV. So approximately 36 MeV difference. 

But the problem states "the precision is at 1e-4", the difference between 14,371 and 14,407 is more than 1e-4 relative to the magnitude. Hence, using the precise mass vs the approximate mass makes a difference. 

Therefore, the problem expects us to use the exact mass. Therefore 14,407.8466 MeV.

Thus, the answer is \boxed{14407.8466} MeV.

Alternatively, converted to GeV, that's 14.4078466 GeV, so with precision 1e-4 when in GeV, four decimal places would be 14.4078 GeV. So might the problem expect the answer in GeV? If that's the case, answer is \boxed{14.4078} GeV. But without units specified in the problem, maybe they assume MeV. But unsure. Wait, the original question says "energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider". Accelerators are usually configured to specific energies per particle. RHIC's typical energies are recorded in GeV per nucleon. For instance, 100 GeV per nucleon. However, since this is a problem, and Lithium-6, perhaps answer is presented as total kinetic energy per nucleus. If per nucleus, then yeah, the answer depends on what's needed. But given that the calculation led us to around 14,407.8 MeV. 14,407.8466 MeV.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer in joules or another unit? Unlikely. Most probably it's in MeV or GeV.

Given the precision required is four decimal places, write it as 14407.8466 MeV. Which would satisfy the precision. But let's check if there's any step that we rounded too early.

Referencing back, we calculate m*c² as 5,603.0514537 MeV exactly. Then multiply by (γ -1) = 18/7. The calculation was exact since 5,603.0514537 * 18 /7 can be calculated without approximation.

18 /7 * 5,603.0514537:

= (18 * 5,603.0514537) /7

Calculate 5,603.0514537 * 18:

First compute 5,000 * 18 = 90,000

603.0514537 * 18: 600*18=10,800; 3.0514537*18=54.9261666

Sum: 10,800 +54.9261666=10,854.9261666

Total: 90,000 +10,854.9261666=100,854.9261666

Now divide by 7:

100,854.9261666 /7 = ?

7*14,407 = 100,849. Hence, 100,854.9261666 - 100,849 = 5.9261666

5.9261666 /7 ≈ 0.8465952 (matches prior calculation)

Thus, the exact value is 14,407.8465952 MeV. So approximately 14,407.8466 when rounded to four decimal places.

Thus, the answer is \boxed{14407.8466} MeV.

Another thing, however, sometimes in accelerator physics, the energy is given as the kinetic energy per nucleon. If that's the case, we divide the total kinetic energy by 6 (since Lithium-6 has 6 nucleons).

Calculating that:

14,407.8465952 /6 ≈ 2,401.307766 MeV per nucleon. Which is 2.4013 GeV per nucleon. 

But the problem didn't specify whether it's total or per nucleon. Given that it says "the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c", speed is a property of the entire nucleus, not per nucleon. Therefore, the kinetic energy in question is total kinetic energy per nucleus. Therefore, stick with the original answer.

Therefore, boxed answer is \boxed{14407.8466} MeV.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{14407.8466}
