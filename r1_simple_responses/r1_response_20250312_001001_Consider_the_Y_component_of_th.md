To find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \( A_y \), we start by noting that \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the Pauli-Y matrix given by:

\[
S = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}
\]

First, we determine the eigenvalues of \( A_y \). The eigenvalues of the Pauli-Y matrix \( S \) are \( \pm 1 \). Since \( A_y \) is \( c \) times \( S \), the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm c \). Substituting \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \), the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are:

\[
\pm \frac{h}{4\pi}
\]

Next, we find the corresponding eigenvectors. For the eigenvalue \( c \), we solve the equation \( (A_y - cI)\phi = 0 \):

\[
\begin{pmatrix} -c & -ic \\ ic & -c \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} \phi_1 \\ \phi_2 \end{pmatrix} = 0
\]

This leads to the equations:
\[
-c\phi_1 - ic\phi_2 = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad ic\phi_1 - c\phi_2 = 0
\]

Solving these, we find \(\phi_1 = -i\phi_2\). Thus, the eigenvector is proportional to \( \begin{pmatrix} -i \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \).

For the eigenvalue \(-c\), we solve the equation \( (A_y + cI)\phi = 0 \):

\[
\begin{pmatrix} c & -ic \\ ic & c \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} \phi_1 \\ \phi_2 \end{pmatrix} = 0
\]

This leads to the equations:
\[
c\phi_1 - ic\phi_2 = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad ic\phi_1 + c\phi_2 = 0
\]

Solving these, we find \(\phi_1 = i\phi_2\). Thus, the eigenvector is proportional to \( \begin{pmatrix} i \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \).

### Final Answer
The eigenvalues of the operator \( A_y \) are \( \boxed{\pm \frac{h}{4\pi}} \) with corresponding eigenvectors proportional to \( \begin{pmatrix} -i \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \) and \( \begin{pmatrix} i \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \).

# R1 reasoning

Okay, so I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay, which is given as c times the matrix S, where c is h/(4π) and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has its first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). Hmm, let me see. 

First, eigenvalues. Right, eigenvalues are the solutions to the equation Ay φ = a φ. Since Ay is c times S, maybe I can factor out the constant c and find the eigenvalues of S first, then multiply by c to get the eigenvalues of Ay. That might simplify things. Let me check. 

The matrix S looks familiar. Wait, isn't that similar to the Pauli matrices? The Pauli Y matrix is exactly [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S here is the Pauli Y matrix. So if Ay = c * S_y, then the eigenvalues of Ay would be c times the eigenvalues of S_y. The eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices are ±1. Wait, but Pauli matrices are for spin-1/2 particles, so their eigenvalues are ±ħ/2, but here the standard S_y would have eigenvalues ±ħ/2. Hmm, but here in the problem statement, S is given as a 2x2 matrix (0, -i; i, 0), which is exactly the Pauli Y matrix except maybe a factor. Wait, the standard Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. For σ_y, it's [[0, -i], [i, 0]], and then the spin operator S_y would be (ħ/2)σ_y. So if in this problem, the matrix S is exactly the Pauli Y matrix, then S here must correspond to S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y. But in the problem, Ay = c S. And they specify that c is h/(4π). Wait, h is Planck's constant. But ħ is h/(2π), so c here is ħ/2. Let's check that. If c = h/(4π), then that's (6.626...)/4π, but in terms of ħ, which is h/(2π), so h/(4π) = ħ/2. Therefore, Ay = (ħ/2) S. But wait, S in the problem is the Pauli matrix, which is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So perhaps in this problem, the operator S is not scaled by ħ/2. That's possible. So the standard spin operator for spin-1/2 is S_y = (ħ/2) σ_y. But here, S is just σ_y. Then Ay = (ħ/2) σ_y if c is h/(4π), which equals ħ/2. Yes.

Therefore, Ay is effectively the spin angular momentum operator in the y-direction for spin-1/2 particles, scaled by ħ/2. But eigenvalues of the spin operators for spin-1/2 are ±ħ/2. Let me verify that. Let me compute the eigenvalues of the matrix Ay. Let's construct Ay.

First, let's compute S. The matrix S is:

Row 1: 0, -i
Row 2: i, 0

Multiply that by c = h/(4π). Therefore, Ay is:

[ [0, -i*c], [i*c, 0] ]

To find eigenvalues, we need to solve the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0.

So,

| -a      -i*c     |
| i*c     -a      |

Determinant is (-a)(-a) - (-i*c)(i*c) = a^2 - (-i^2)(c^2) = a^2 - (-(-1))c^2 = a^2 - c^2.

Set this equal to zero: a^2 - c^2 = 0 → a^2 = c^2 → a = ±c.

So the eigenvalues are a = +c and a = -c.

But let's confirm. Since Ay is c times the Pauli Y matrix, the eigenvalues of σ_y are ±1, so multiplying by c should result in eigenvalues ±c. Therefore, the eigenvalues are indeed ±c, which is ±h/(4π). Wait, but for standard spin-1/2, S_y has eigenvalues ±ħ/2. Since ħ = h/(2π), so h/(4π) = ħ/2. So yes, that would give eigenvalues ±h/(4π), which is ħ/2 each. So that checks out with the standard result if we have c = ħ/2.

So maybe that holds. So the eigenvalues are ±c, so ±h/(4π). Therefore, correct eigenvalues.

Now eigenvectors. Let's find the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue.

First, for a = c:

We need to solve (Ay - c I) φ = 0.

Ay - c I is:

[ -c  -i c ]

[ i c -c ]

So the equations are:

- c φ1 - i c φ2 = 0

i c φ1 - c φ2 = 0

We can divide both equations by c (assuming c ≠ 0, which it isn't).

First equation: -φ1 - i φ2 = 0 → φ1 = -i φ2

Second equation: i φ1 - φ2 = 0

Substitute φ1 from first equation into second equation:

i (-i φ2) - φ2 = (-i^2 φ2) - φ2 = ( - (-1) φ2) - φ2 = φ2 - φ2 = 0. So it's consistent.

Therefore, we can parametrize the eigenvectors as φ2 = t, φ1 = -i t. Then the eigenvector is proportional to [-i, 1]^T.

Similarly, for eigenvalue a = -c:

Ay + c I:

[ c  -i c ]

[ i c  c ]

Equations:

c φ1 - i c φ2 = 0 → φ1 = i φ2

i c φ1 + c φ2 = 0 → i φ1 + φ2 = 0

Substitute φ1 = i φ2 into the second equation:

i (i φ2) + φ2 = -1 φ2 + φ2 = 0. Checks out.

Therefore, eigenvector is proportional to [i, 1]^T.

Therefore, eigenvalues are ±c and corresponding eigenvectors are [-i, 1]^T and [i, 1]^T, up to scaling.

Wait, but usually in quantum mechanics, the eigenvectors of the Pauli matrices are normalized. For σ_y, for instance, the eigenvectors are 1/√2 times [1, ±i]^T, but rotated depending on the matrix's representation. Wait, maybe not.

Wait, let's get back. Let me make sure. If Ay has eigenvectors proportional to [-i, 1]^T and [i, 1]^T, normalized.

Wait. To normalize the first eigenvector, [-i, 1]. The norm is sqrt( | -i |^2 + |1|^2 ) = sqrt(1 + 1) = sqrt(2). So normalized eigenvector is (1/√2)(-i, 1), and similarly (1/√2)(i, 1). 

But the question is not asking for normalized eigenvectors exactly. It just says eigenvectors, so maybe it's up to a scalar multiple.

So the eigenvalues are ±c, with c = h/(4π). So ±h/(4π). 

But the question didn't explicitly ask for numerical calculation. It just mentioned during the calculation, which statement is correct. So maybe the options given in the problem consider some choices.

But according to what's here, the eigenvalues are ±c, with eigenvectors being [-i,1] and [i,1]. So during the calculation statements, correct statements would be that the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π), eigenvectors are proportional to (-i, 1) and (i, 1). Alternatively, eigenvalues are ± ħ/2, since c = h/(4π) is ħ/2.

Wait. Let me confirm: h/(4π) = (2π ħ)/(4π) ) = ħ/2. So c = ħ/2. Therefore, eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. But the problem says c = h/(4π). So in terms of h, the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π), but if the options are written in terms of ħ, probably can have ±ħ/2 as eigenvalues. So if the potential answer choices are about the eigenvalues, the correct answer would state that the eigenvalues are ±ħ/2 (since h/(4π) = ħ/2). Similarly, ħ is hbar (reduced Planck's constant), which is commonly used in angular momentum problems.

But the problem statement says "the eigenvalue equation Ay(φ) = a(φ)", so the eigenvalue a is given. Since Ay is expressed in terms of h/(4π), then the eigenvalues would be ± h/(4π). Alternatively, depending on the given answer choices, which might be easier with modulus. But since the problem didn't list the options, just to say, during the process, what's considered correct.

Assuming the thought process needs to recap key steps for eigenvalues and eigenvectors. I've considered solving the characteristic equation found eigenvalues ±c = ±h/(4π). Then, computed eigenvectors by substituting into the equations, gotten the eigenvectors as proportional to [-i, 1] and [i,1]. 

But perhaps in standard notation for spin-1/2 systems, the eigenvectors of S_y are usually [1, ±i]^T divided by sqrt(2). Wait, yes. Wait:

Suppose we have σ_y matrix [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Then if you compute eigenvalues:

The eigenvalues are ±1. The eigenvectors for λ=1, need to solve:

[ -1   -i ] [x]   = 0
[ i    -1 ] [y]

So -x -i y =0 ⇒ x = -i y

Substitution into other equation: i x -y = i (-i y) - y = (1) y - y =0. So x = -i y. So eigenvector [ -i, 1 ], normalized, is [ -i, 1 ] / sqrt(2). Similarly, eigenvector for -1 is [ i, 1 ] / sqrt(2). But often they are presented as [1, i]/sqrt(2) etc. but depending on convention.

Alternatively, they can be written as (|+>_y = 1/sqrt(2)( |0> + i |1> )) and |->_y = 1/sqrt(2)( |0> - i |1> ), but here the eigenvectors would be [1; i] and [1; -i]. Wait, wait, if |0> is [1; 0], then 1/sqrt(2)( |0> + i |1> ) is 1/sqrt(2)[1; i], whereas here our eigenvectors are [-i,1 ] and [i,1]. However, note that:

[ -i, 1 ] is the same, up to a phase, as [1, i ], because multiplying by i: i * [-i,1 ] = [ -i^2, i ] = [1, i ].

Similarly, the other eigenvector [i, 1 ] multiplied by -i gives [ -i^2, -i ] = [1, -i ].

Thus, the eigenvectors of Ay (which is (ħ/2) σ_y ) are proportional to [1, i ] and [1, -i ], up to a phase factor.

But in the calculation here, they come out as [-i,1 ] and [i, 1 ].

Therefore, both are correct, as eigenvectors can be scalar multiples. The overall structure is that eigenvectors must have components related by the equation φ1 = ∓i φ2. So they must be of the form [ ∓i, 1 ]^T.

Therefore, during the calculation, these would be the eigenvectors. 

So in conclusion, the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π) (or ±ħ/2), and eigenvectors are proportional to [-i, 1] and [i, 1].

Now, possible correct statements could be about eigenvalues being ±c, where c is h/(4π) or ħ/2, or about eigenvectors having entries with the imaginary unit. If this process leads to recognizing the eigenvalues as h/(4π) multiplied by ±1, hence ±h/(4π), and eigenvectors related with imaginary components, then the correct statements would be in line with that. 

But since the user just asks "During the calculation, which statement below will you consider to be correct?" but without presenting the options, this thought process is just to verify that I need to check against possible options which might be:

1. Eigenvalues are ±h/(4π)

2. Eigenvalues are ±ħ/2

3. Eigenvectors are (1, ±i) normalized by 1/√2

4. Or ( -i, 1 ) etc.

But given that the problem mentioned using constant c = h/4π, which is equivalent to ħ/2, eigenvalues can be written both ways, depending on the options. So likely both 1 and 2 are correct, depending on the presentation. But if options present the eigenvalues in terms of h, then ±h/(4π); if in terms of ħ, then ±ħ/2. Similarly, eigenvectors would have components with i as in choice 3, but possibly presented as (-i,1) and (i,1). Either way, normalization factors (like 1/sqrt(2)) might be considered, but sometimes eigenvectors are considered up to scaling. So if the options mention any of those, they would be correct.

Possibly the correct statement would be about eigenvalues being ±h/(4π), given the problem states c = h/(4π), and eigenvectors proportional to [-i, 1] and [i,1].

So I need to check each step again. Eigenvalues calculated of Ay as ±c, which is h/(4π), and eigenvectors as [-i, 1] and [i,1]. So during calculation, the key points would be confirming eigenvalues via determinant leading to ±c, and eigenvectors solved from the equations enforcing relations between components involving i, resulting in these vectors.

Yeah, that seems about right. So if given this as options, statements declaring those eigenvalues and eigenvectors would be correct.


**Final Answer**
The eigenvalues of the operator \( A_y \) are \( \boxed{\pm \frac{h}{4\pi}} \) with corresponding eigenvectors proportional to \( \begin{pmatrix} -i \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \) and \( \begin{pmatrix} i \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \).
