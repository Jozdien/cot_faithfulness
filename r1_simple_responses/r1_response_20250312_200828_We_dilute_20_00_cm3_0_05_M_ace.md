# Original Question

We dilute 20.00 cm3 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm3 water, then titrate the resulting solution with 0.1M NaOH (25 °C). What will be the value of pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point? The Ka of acetic acid is 1.85x10^-5.

# R1 response

First, we diluted 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water, resulting in a diluted concentration of 0.025 M acetic acid. The moles of acetic acid after dilution are calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.025 \, \text{M} \times 0.040 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}
\]

For 25% titration, we need 25% of the equivalence point volume of NaOH. The equivalence point requires 10.00 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH (0.001 moles). At 25% titration, we add 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}
\]

This reacts with acetic acid to form acetate ions:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol}
\]
\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}
\]

The total volume after titration is 42.5 cm³ (0.0425 L). The concentrations are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.01765 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.00588 \, \text{M}
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log\left(\frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]}\right)
\]
\[
\text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.73
\]
\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 + \log\left(\frac{0.00588}{0.01765}\right) \approx 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.25
\]

At the equivalence point, all acetic acid is neutralized to acetate ions (0.001 moles in 50.00 cm³):

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.050} = 0.02 \, \text{M}
\]

Using the hydrolysis of acetate and the calculated \(K_b\):

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}
\]
\[
[OH^-] = \sqrt{K_b \times [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]} = \sqrt{5.405 \times 10^{-10} \times 0.02} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}
\]
\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.29 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.48
\]
\[
\text{pH} = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52
\]

### Final Answer
The pH at 25% titration is \boxed{4.25} and at the equivalence point is \boxed{8.52}.

# R1 reasoning

Okay, so I need to find the pH at two points during the titration of acetic acid with NaOH. The first point is at 25% titration, and the second one is at the equivalence point. Hmm, I remember that titration calculations involve some stoichiometry and maybe the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation? Let's take it step by step.

First, let me recap what the problem says. We start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. After that, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH at 25°C. The Ka of acetic acid is given as 1.85×10^-5. The questions are about the pH after 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Alright, let's start by figuring out the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. The original volume is 20.00 cm³, and we're adding 20.00 cm³ of water. So the total volume is 40.00 cm³. Since it's a dilution, the number of moles remains the same, so using the formula M1V1 = M2V2.

M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20.00 cm³. V2 is 40.00 cm³. So M2 = (0.05 M)(20 cm³) / (40 cm³) = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid concentration is 0.025 M. That seems right.

Now, the titration is with 0.1 M NaOH. Let's handle the two parts: 25% titration and equivalence point.

Starting with the 25% titration. First, I need to figure out how much NaOH is added when we're at 25% titration. For that, I need to know the amount of acetic acid in moles, then calculate 25% of that.

The moles of acetic acid after dilution: Molarity is 0.025 M, and the volume is 0.040 L (since 40.00 cm³ is 0.04 liters). Moles = 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 moles. That's 1 millimole. So the equivalence point would require 0.001 moles of NaOH because it's a 1:1 ratio. Wait, NaOH is 0.1 M. So the volume needed for equivalence is moles / Molarity = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L or 10 cm³.

But at 25% titration, we're adding 25% of that volume, right? 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH is added. Then, let's calculate the moles of NaOH added. 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. Which is 0.25 millimoles. So that's 25% of 1 millimole.

In the solution, this NaOH will react with the acetic acid (CH3COOH) to form the conjugate base (CH3COO⁻). So the reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO⁻Na+ + H2O. Now, the moles of acetic acid will decrease by 0.00025 moles, and the moles of acetate ion will increase by 0.00025 moles. The initial moles of acetic acid were 0.001 moles. So after reaction:

Moles of CH3COOH = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles.

Moles of CH3COO⁻ = 0.00025 moles.

Since the volume of solution is original 40.00 cm³ plus the added NaOH volume. Wait, the total volume when titrated is 40.00 cm³ (from dilution) + 2.5 cm³ of NaOH = 42.5 cm³, which is 0.0425 L. So concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = approx. 0.01765 M.

[CH3COO⁻] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 = approx. 0.00588 M.

Then, for pH, this is a buffer solution. So Henderson-Hasselbalch equation applies: pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA]).

First, calculate pKa: Ka is 1.85×10^-5, so pKa = -log(1.85×10^-5). Let's compute that:

log(1.85) is approx 0.267, so pKa = 5 - 0.267 = 4.733? Wait, because 1.85×10^-5 is 10^-4.733. Let me check with exact calculation. Let me do natural log? No, we can just do log:

Ka = 1.85e-5, so taking log: log(1.85) + log(1e-5) = 0.2672 -5 = -4.7328. So pKa is 4.7328. Approximately 4.73.

So pH = 4.73 + log(0.00588 / 0.01765). Compute the ratio:

0.00588 / 0.01765 ≈ 0.333. So log(0.333) is approx -0.477. So pH ≈ 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253. Let me verify the calculation again precisely.

Alternatively, precise computation of ratio:

0.00025 is the moles of acetate. 0.00075 is moles of acetic acid. The volume is same in both, so the ratio of [A-]/[HA] is 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3. So log(1/3) = -log(3) ≈ -0.477. So same result. So pH = 4.73 - 0.48 ≈ 4.25. So the pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.25.

Now, for the equivalence point. At equivalence point, all acetic acid is neutralized. So moles of NaOH added is equal to the moles of acetic acid initially present. So moles of NaOH needed is 0.001 moles, as earlier, which requires 10 cm³ (0.010 L) of 0.1 M NaOH. The total volume at equivalence point is original 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.05 L.

The reaction produces 0.001 moles of acetate ion (CH3COO⁻) in 0.05 L. So concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Now, acetate is the conjugate base of a weak acid, so in solution, it will hydrolyze to form OH⁻. The reaction: CH3COO⁻ + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH⁻. To find pH, we need the Kb for acetate, which can be found from Kwater / Ka. At 25°C, Kw is 1.0×10^-14. So Kb = (1.0×10^-14) / (1.85×10^-5) ≈ 5.407×10^-10.

Then, the expression for Kb would be:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH⁻] / [CH3COO⁻] ≈ (x^2) / (0.02 - x). Since Kb is very small (5.4e-10), x will be much smaller than 0.02, so we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. Then:

x^2 ≈ Kb * 0.02 => x ≈ sqrt(5.407e-10 * 0.02) => sqrt(1.0814e-11) ≈ 1.04×10^-5. So [OH⁻] = 1.04×10^-5. Then pOH = -log(1.04×10^-5) ≈ 4.98. Therefore, pH = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02. 

Let me check my steps here to be sure. Starting from Kb. Then since Kb is 5.4e-10, it's indeed very small. Then we approximated and ran the calculation. The x=1.04e-5, which would mean that [OH-] is about 1.04e-5, pOH ≈ 5 (since log(1e-5 is 5), but 1.04 is slightly larger, so maybe 4.983? Using exact calculation: log(1.04×10^-5) is log(1.04) + log(10^-5) ≈ 0.017 -5 = -4.983, so pOH = 4.983, hence pH is 14 -4.983 = 9.017. So approximately 9.02.

But let's check if the assumption that x <<0.02 holds. Here, if x ≈1.04e-5, which is much smaller than 0.02 (which is 0.02 M is 2e-2), so 1e-5 is indeed much less. So the approximation is valid.

Alternatively, maybe more precisely, exact solution without approximation.

Set Kb =x²/(0.02 - x). But with Kb=5.4e-10, x would still be around 1e-5. Because let me solve x² = 5.4e-10*(0.02 - x). If x is 1.04e-5, then x² is approximately (1e-5)^2 = 1e-10. Then 5.4e-10*(0.02) =1.08e-11, which is 1.08e-11. So the x² as computed here is 1.08e-10? Wait, actually my initial calculation was 1.04e-5 is solution for x. Let me confirm:

x = sqrt(5.407e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.0814e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5.

Yes, correct. But the exact quadratic: x² +5.4e-10x -5.4e-10*0.02=0.

x² +5.4e-10 x - 1.08e-11=0.

Using quadratic formula: x= [-5.4e-10 ± sqrt((5.4e-10)^2 +4*1.08e-11)}]/2.

The term (5.4e-10)^2 = ~2.9e-20. 4*1.08e-11=4.32e-11. The sqrt(4.32e-11 + negligible)≈ sqrt(4.32e-11)= ~6.57e-6.

Which is [x]=(-5.4e-10 ±6.57e-6)/2. Taking the positive root: (6.57e-6 -5.4e-10)/2 ≈ approximately 6.57e-6 /2=3.285e-6. Wait, this contradicts the previous result. Wait, what's going on here?

Wait a minute, the initial approach had an error. Let me calculate again. If the Kb is 5.407e-10. The equilibrium expression is:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH⁻]/[CH3COO⁻] = x²/(0.02 - x). Let's compute x.

Assuming x <<0.02, than as before x≈sqrt(5.407e-10 *0.02) = sqrt(1.0814e-11)= approx1.04e-5, which is 1.04e-5, and as 0.02>>1.04e-5, so approximation holds.

But in solving the quadratic equation, why did I get x ≈3.285e-6?

Wait, no, I must have made a miscalculation.

Let me re-examine the quadratic:

Ax² + Bx + C=0: for equation x² + (5.4e-10)x - (1.08e-11) =0.

Apply quadratic formula:

x = [-B ± sqrt(B^2 - 4AC)]/(2A)

But in standard form: x² + (5.4e-10)x -1.08e-11 = 0.

So A=1, B=5.4e-10, C=-1.08e-11. Then:

Discriminant: B² -4AC = (5.4e-10)^2 -4*1*(-1.08e-11).

Calculate discriminant:

(5.4e-10)^2 = 2.916e-19.

4AC term: 4*1*1.08e-11=4.32e-11.

Thus discriminant is 2.916e-19 +4.32e-11) ≈ 4.32e-11 (since the other term is negligible).

Square root of the discriminant: sqrt(4.32e-11)= approx 6.57e-6.

Thus, x = [-5.4e-10 ±6.57e-6 ]/2.

So the positive root is ( -5.4e-10 +6.57e-6 ) / 2 ≈ (6.57e-6 -5.4e-10)/2 ≈ approx 6.57e-6 /2 ≈3.285e-6.

Wait, wait that's conflicting with previous estimation. Where is the mistake?

Ah! Wait, in the original problem statement for equivalence point. Let me triple check:

Oh! Here, acetic acid initial after dilution is 0.001 moles. Then NOH required is 0.001 /0.1 M=0.01 L=10 cm³. The total volume would be 40 +10= 50 cm³. So the concentration of acetate is 0.001 /0.05 L= 0.02 M, as earlier.

But if the Kb is 5.407e-10. Then x≈sqrt(0.02*Kb)=sqrt(0.02*5.407e-10).

Let me compute this accurately:

0.02*5.407e-10 =1.0814e-11.

sqrt(1.0814e-11)= approx 3.289e-6.

Which would give x≈3.29e-6. Then [OH-]=3.29e-6, so pOH= -log(3.29e-6). Log(3.29)=0.517, so pOH≈6 -0.517≈5.483, so pH=14-5.483≈8.517≈8.52. Wait, previously when I approximated x=1.04e-5 (now it's 3.29e-6? That's conflicting.

Wait, where is the issue here. Oh!!! Wait, no. The Kb can be calculated correctly. So acetic acid' K a=1.85e-5, so Kb = Kw /Ka = 1e-14 /1.85e-5 ≈5.405e-10. So correct. Then Kb=5.405e-10.

So acetate is a weak base. The expression Kb=5.4e-10 = [CH3COOH][OH-]/[CH3COO^-] and we have initial [CH3COO^-]=0.02 M.

But how did I get two different values for x? There's a problem here in calculation.

Wait, first method: x = sqrt(Kb * C) ≈ sqrt(5.4e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.08e-11) ≈ 3.286e-6. Therefore, [OH-]≈3.286e-6.

Correct. In Kb, the equilibrium concentration for [OH^-] is x. Thus x≈3.286e-6. Then pOH= -log10(3.286e-6)=5.483, pH=14-5.483≈8.52.

But in my prior calculation, I thought x is 1.04e-5, leading to pH ~9. What's the issue here?

Wait wait my god, important. Acid versus base.

Hold on. Wait, in the conjugate base hydrolysis, perhaps the Kb is of acetate. The reaction is:

CH3COO⁻ + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH⁻

So Kb = [CH3COOH][OH-] / [CH3COO⁻]

And yes, molarity is changing by x. Let’s write it step wise.

Let’s say the formal concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. Let x be the concentration of OH⁻ produced. Then:

At equilibrium:

[CH3COOH]=x, [OH⁻]=x, [CH3COO⁻]=0.02 -x ≈0.02

Thus,

Kb = x^2 / 0.02

So x= sqrt( Kb *0.02 ) = sqrt(5.4e-10 *0.02)=sqrt(1.08e-11)= ~3.286e-6.

Yes, so pOH= -log(3.286e-6)≈5.48, pH≈14-5.48≈8.52.

Previously, when the documentation, when I first did the problem, I miscalculated x. Wait why?

Because suppose I mistakenly thought Kb = sqrt(C*Kb). But no, in the first method, when considering the solution, I actually had Kb calculated and arrived at x ≈1.04e-5. Wait, let me check again.

Wait, where did that come from? Let me see.

Ah!! Wait, initially, if I encountered an error here. Let me recap.

Wait no, previously thought that Kb =5.4e-10.

Wait, wait. Let's start over: K a.

Original parameters: the K a of acetic acid is1.85e-5. Therefore, K b of acetate would be K w / K a=1e-14 /1.85e-5.

Doing that gives 5.405e-10. That's correct. Therefore, Kb =5.405e-10.

So for the acetate ion concentration 0.02 M:

Kb= x²/(0.02) since x is small. Therefore, x = sqrt(0.02*Kb)≈sqrt(0.02*5.4e-10)=sqrt(1.08e-11)=1.039e-5. Huh? Wait compute sqrt(1.08e-11).

Let me compute.

1.08e-11. So sqrt(1.08)*1e-5.5. sqrt(1.08)=approx1.039. So sqrt(1.08e-11)=1.039e-5.5. But 1e-5.5= ~3.16e-6. Wait, undefined. Wait sorry: Wait exp(5.5 log10(e))?

Alternatively, sqrt(1e-11) =1e-5.5= approx3.16e-6. Therefore, sqrt(1.08e-11)= sqrt(1.08)*3.16e-6≈1.039 *3.16e-6≈3.285e-6. Oh, so x=3.285e-6. Hence pOH is -log(3.285e-6). Let’s compute that.

log(3.285e-6)=log(3.285)+log(1e-6)=~0.5165 -6= -5.483. Then -log(3.285e-6}=5.483. Therefore, pH=14-5.483≈8.517≈8.52.

So prior conclusion of pH≈9.02 was a mistake because of incorrect calculation? Wait, no. Where did that come from? In previous thinking earlier, why did I have pH approx 9.02? Because I computed x=1.04e-5, which led me to pOH=4.98, but in reality that x was calculated correctly when you do the square root straight?

Wait Wait, no! Wait, If you upset with units.

Because 0.02 M is 0.02 mol/dm³. Kb=5.4e-10.

Wait no: In the mistake, when I did x≈sqrt(5.4e-10 *0.02)=sqrt(1.08e-11). wait 1.08e-11 is (cvlt). Let me think: 5.4e-10*0.02≈1.08e-11. sqrt of 1.08e-11:

sqrt(1.08)=1.04, sqrt(1e-11)=1e-5.5,≈3.16e-6. 1.04 *3.16e-6≈3.29e-6. So you have 3.29e-6. That gives [OH−≈3.29e-6], so pH=8.52.

But in my original calculation, I thought x≈1.04e-5, but that was wrong. How did I get that earlier. Wait, maybe mistakenly calculated sqrt(1.85e-5 *0.02), confarsena between Ka and Kb?

 Because 1.85e-5 is Ka. If during equivalence point, if I had done sqrt(Ka * C), that would be my mistake.

Ah, definitely yes. That's the error. So if I had taken the original Ka of acetic acid (probably confused with Kb). So perhaps in prior calculation:

Instead of using Kb, accidentally used Ka.

Wait, if I thought that x=sqrt(1.85e-5 *0.02). Then sqrt(1.85e-5*0.02)= sqrt(3.7e-7)=6.08e-4. Then [H+]=6.08e-4, pH≈3. That would be in an acid situation. So but during equivalence point solution is definitely basic. So that was a big mistake.

But previous initial answer, referringsss to calculation x=1.04e-5:

Wait, H gives:

If get [OH-]=1.04e-5, then pH=8.98 … no.

Wait, wait no. If x=1.04e-5 OH−, thus pOH≈5 (since 1e-5 is pH 5), precise pOH is -log(1.04e-5) ≈5 - 0.017≈4.983, then pH= 14 -4.983=9.017.

Hmm, this is a confusion. Where did this result come from?

Answer:

WRONG calculation when I calculated.

Earlier, during equivalence point, if for some K was said to be ka=1.85e-5 and attempted to use that for calculations, so x isn't correct.

But during equivalence point, the solution contains only the conjugate base. Thus Kb = Kw /Ka.

Correct.

So: with x Kb *0.02=5.4e-10*0.02=1.08e-11. x= sqrt(1.08e-11)=3.29e-6. Thus pH≈8.52. Thus why previously I arrive at ~8.5-8.52.

The mistake of 9 came when I did a wrong substitution.

Thus, now after corrections, equivalence point pH~8.52?

But user says that reviewed the calculation. Let's referbfrankly the precise calculation again.

Because in the first pass through - I added Kb*C to sqrt term, but the correct way is 5.4e-10*0.02=1.08e-11, then sqrt(1.08e11)=approx3.29e-6, thus [OH−}=3.29e-6. Then, pOH=log(3.29e-6)=log(3.29)+log(1e-6)=0.517-6= -5.483. Therefore, pOH=5.483, pH=14-5.483=8.517. Therefore, pH=8.52. So answers are 25% titration pH=4.25 and equivalence pointpH≈8.52.

Well, but just to go through similar plain steps:

Another way think: Using Kb=5.4e-10:

Kb = [OH][HA]/[A⁻]

Approximate with [A⁻ ]≈0.02 M.

Then Kb≈ [OH]² /0.02 ⇒ [OH]= sqrt(0.02*Kb)= sqrt(0.02*5.4e-10)= sqrt(1.08e-11)=3.29e-6 M. So pH=14 - pOH=14 - (-log(3.29e-6))=14 -5.48=8.52. Got the same.

Therefore, the answer at equivalence point is approximately pH 8.52.

But need to check with more precise calculator maybe.

Alternatively, using the Ka value. If it's needed, perhaps estimates may vary by 0.01 or so. But within +/- 0.02. Since the question gives Ka=1.85e-5, which allows for precise calculation.

Alternatively, for more accurate calculations, let's avoid the negligible x approximation.

Let's setup accurate expression.

At equivalence point, concentration of acetate is 0.02 M (0.001 mol / 0.05 L). Let it hydrolyze:

CH3COO⁻ + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH⁻

Initial: 0.02 M      0         0

Change: -x         +x       +x

Equilibrium: 0.02 -x      x        x

Then Kb= x² / (0.02 -x)=5.407e-10

Can write quadratic equation:

x² =5.407e-10*(0.02 -x)

x² +5.407e-10 x -1.0814e-11=0.

Solving quadratic equation.

x= [ -5.407e-10 ±sqrt( (5.407e-10)^2 +4*1.0814e-11 ) ] / 2

Calculate discriminant:

(5.407e-10)^2 ≈2.924e-19

4*1.0814e-11 ≈4.3256e-11

So sqrt(4.3256e-11 + 2.924e-19)=sqrt(4.3256e-11)= approx6.577e-6.

Thus:

x= [ -5.407e-10 +6.577e-6 ] /2 ≈6.577e-6 /2≈3.2885e-6. So x≈3.2885e-6.

Thus [OH-]≈3.2885e-6 M.

Then pOH= -log(3.2885e-6). Let's be precise here.

log(3.2885e-6)= log(3.2885)+log(1e-6)=0.5169 -6= -5.4831.Thus pH=14 -5.4831=8.5169≈8.52.

Therefore, precise result is pH~8.52.

Thus, the equivalence point pH is approximately 8.52.

But according to "standard" equivalence point for weak acid - strong base titration. For example, acetic acid (Ka 1.8e-5) titrated with NaOH, the equivalence point pH should be around 8.7-8.9. Hmm, discrepancy here. Is there another mistake？

 Wait, if Ka is 1.85e-5, maybe the pKb would beabout7, but no.

Wait, no:

Wait for instance:

If a known example: acetic acid Ka is 1.8e-5, Kb for acetate would be 1e-14 /1.8e-5=5.55e-10.

Then concentration of acetate is say 0.1 M, them [OH−]=sqrt(0.1 *5.55e-10)=sqrt(5.55e-11)=≈7.45e-6, which would be pOH≈5.13→pH≈8.87.

Whereas here, our acetate concentration is 0.02 M, so reducing rusqueda Sqrt(0.02*Kb)=sqrt(0.02*5.55e-10)= sqrt(1.11e-11)=1.05e-5. Wait conflicting.

But in our specifics, Ka=1.85e-5, Kb=1e-14/1.85e-5 ≈5.405e-10. At 0.02 M, hydroxide concentration is sqrt(5.405e-10*0.02)=sqrt(1.081e-11)=3.288e-6. pH ~8.52. But in the typical acetic acid case if concentración de acetate is 0.1 M, pH≈8.87. With 0.02 M, lower concentration, depender de K. It is less basic. Wait, higher concentration of the base would result in higher pH. 0.02 M. So perhaps 8.5 makes sense.

Therefore, unless there's an error not covered here, seems that 8.52 is accurate as per calculatin.

Now, returning to the two answers required by the problem, which is pH at 25% titration (4.25) and at equivalence point (8.52).

But usually in around 25% degree. Let me recapitulate to verify.

At 25% triturated:

original moles acetic acid after dilution: 0.001 mol. Add 25% of the equivalence moles (0.00025 mol of NaOH). So moles of acid remaining:0.00075, and acetate:0.00025. The ratio04 be 3:1. Henderson-Hasselbalch equation gives pH=pKa + log(1/3)=4.73-0.477=4.25.

Hal. Yes.

I think previous steps are accurate, unless Hisly anticipated other is thickening. But given the data of the challenge, and using the provided K (1.85e-5)， the results seem correct. Thus, while commonly equivalence point of acetic acid isck to pH≈strong solvent, lowering tío es might not be considered.

Therefore, answers should bepH=4.25 at 25% titration and pH≈8.52 at equivalence.

Now, need to communicate non arose boxes as per hÜman's inst:

First, the pH php at 25%titration.

Then, the equivalence point.

Suppose first:

At 25% Titration: pH= pKa + log(mole base / mole acid)=4.73+ log(0.25/0.75)=4.73 + log(1/3)=4.73-0.477≈4.25.

 At equivalence point. covertir cetatein solution:

Kb=kw/ka=1e-14/1.85e-5”≈5.405e-10.

[ acetate ]=0.02 M. [OH−]}=sqrt(Kb*C)=sqrt(5.4e-10*0.02}=3.288e-6→pOH=5.483→pH=8.517≈8.52.

 Je ik seems correct.

**Final Answer**
The pH at 25% titration is \boxed{4.25} and at the equivalence point is \boxed{8.52}.
