# R1 reasoning

Okay, so I need to figure out the structure of this compound with the molecular formula C9H11NO2 using the provided IR and 1H NMR data. Let's start by looking at each set of data and see what information I can gather. 

First, the IR spectrum. The peaks at 3420 and 3325 cm-1 are medium to strong intensity. Those are in the range for N-H stretches, maybe from an amine or an amide. Amines usually have stretches around 3300-3500 cm-1. But wait, they are medium to strong, maybe less intense than a primary amine. Alternatively, if it's an amide, the N-H stretches can be a bit lower in that region. Then there's a strong band at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Common groups here are esters, ketones, aldehydes, or maybe amides. But since there's an N-H stretch too, it might not be an amide (since amides typically have a carbonyl around 1650-1750, but along with N-H bends around 1550). Wait, but there's no mention of a band around 1550 here. So perhaps the carbonyl is from an ester or a ketone. However, in the case of an ester, the carbonyl is usually around 1720-1750, so that fits. If it's an ester, the 1720 cm-1 makes sense. 

So maybe we have an ester and an amine group. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's check the degrees of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation are calculated using the formula: DOU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. 

Here, C=9, H=11, N=1, O=2. So DOU = (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20 -11 +1)/2=10/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be one ring plus four double bonds, but more likely, for example, a benzene ring (three DOU), one carbonyl (one DOU), and another ring or double bond. Wait, a benzene ring (3) plus a carbonyl (1) would account for four, so one more would be maybe an oxygen ring, but more plausibly maybe a double bond or an amine as part of a ring?

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe an amide but that would bring in a carbonyl. Wait, but for an amide, they typically have a C=O stretch at around 1650, so 1720 might be too high. Unless it's an acylated amide, perhaps? Or maybe it's an ester. Then the N comes from a different part of the molecule. 

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

1.20 ppm, triplet, 3H: This triplet of 3H is likely a methyl group adjacent to a CH2. Typically in an ethyl group where the CH2 is split by neighboring CH3. For example, in an ethyl ester, the methyl would be a triplet, if adjacent to a CH2O group. The splitting here suggests two neighboring protons, so a CH2 next to CH3. So maybe -OCH2CH3? But that's an ethyl ester. Let's see, ethyl group in an ester gives a triplet for the CH3 at around 1.2-1.4 ppm (here 1.20), and a quartet for the adjacent OCH2 at around 4.0-4.3 (but here 4.5). Hmm. Let me check that shift. The OCH2 in an ethyl ester is usually a quartet around 4.1-4.3 ppm. Here, there's a quartet at 4.5 ppm. Wait, maybe it's adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group, causing upfield or downfield shift? Alternatively, maybe not an ethyl ester but a substitution. Let's see.

There's a 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H). "bs" being broad singlet? That probably indicates an NH2 group that is exchanging, perhaps. Amides often have broad signals due to slow exchange, but in amines, sometimes they can be broad too. However, if it's an amine, like in an aniline derivative where the NH2 is adjacent to electron-withdrawing groups, making the protons deshielded and causing them to exchange slowly. Alternatively, maybe -NH2 in para-aminobenzoic acid. Wait, but molecular formula?

Wait, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let me count the atoms. For instance, if it's something like ethyl para-aminobenzoate. The benzoate would be C7H5O2 (benzoic acid is C7H6O2, replacing -OH with OEt). Then substitution with an ethyl ester would give ethyl p-aminobenzoate. Let's count: Benzoate is C6H5-CO-OEt. So C9H11NO2? Benzoate part is C7H5O2 (COOEt is -O2C-C2H5). So the ester would be C7H5O2 + C2H5? Wait, but perhaps:

Benzoic acid is C6H5COOH. If converted to the ethyl ester, it's C6H5COOEt. Then that's C6H5 (5 carbons) + COOEt (3 carbons?), so total 8 carbons. But our compound has C9. Hmm. Wait, perhaps para-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester. Let's see: para-aminobenzoic acid is NH2-C6H4-COOH. The ester would be NH2-C6H4-COOEt. Then I have 6 carbons in the benzene, 1 in COOEt (but COOEt adds 2 carbons), making a total of 6+2 +2 (NH2 and benzene?). Wait, let me count properly. The formula for ethyl para-aminobenzoate would be C7H7NO2 plus ethanol's ethyl group (so the parent acid is C7H7NO2, replacing H from the COOH by OEt. But wait, the acid is C7H7NO2. Since benzoic acid is C7H6O2, but replacing one H in the benzene ring with NH2 would give C7H7NO2. Then converting -COOH to COOCH2CH3, so we add a CH2CH3 group (which is 2 carbons and possibly adjusting the hydrogens). So the ester would be C7+ 2=9 carbons, N, O2? Wait, let me calculate. Benzoic acid is C6H5COOH (C7H6O2). If in para position, NH2 replaces one H on the benzene, then the acid becomes NH2-C6H4-COOH (C7H7NO2). Converting the COOH to COOEt would make NH2-C6H4-COO-C2H5. The molecular formula would be C7 (from benzene ring + COO) + 2 (from ethyl)? C9H11NO2. Let's count:

NH2-C6H4-COO-Et:

C: 6 (benzene) + 2 (COOEt: COO accounts for O, and ethyl gives 2 C) -> total 6 + 2 +1 in the NH2? Wait, no: benzene (6 carbons) + COO (needs to be part of the count). Wait, wait: structure is NH2-C6H4- (that's 6 carbons + NH2 substituent) connected to COOEt. COOEt is O-C-O- plus ethyl, so the carbons: in the ester group, we have two oxygens in COOEt. So the entire molecule would have:

6 carbons in benzene, 1 in the COO from the benzoic acid, and then the ethyl (2 Cs) → 6 + 1 + 2 =9. Yes. Nitrogen is from the NH2 group. The formula: C9 (6 +1 from COO? Wait not quite. Let me count:

Each benzene ring is 6 C, but when you have COOEt as a substituent, that's a carbonyl group (C=O) attached to an -O-Et. So the carboxylate ester group: the COOEt would contribute one C (from the carbonyl) and the O and Ethyl (2 C). So:

C6 (benzene) +

C (carbonyl) +

OCH2CH3 (2 C) +

NH2 (no C)

Total 6+1+2=9 C. Yes.

Hydrogen: Benzene ring in para substitution would be four H (since two substituents: NH2 and COOEt (as C-O-C-)), then each substituent reduces two H. Wait, benzene normally has 6 H, but two substituents would mean each at para positions, so the ring would have 4 H. The COOEt group: the carbonyl is O, and the ethyl group (OCH2CH3) has 2 CH2 and a CH3. Let's count:

Benzene: 4 H

NH2: 2 H (if primary amine?)

COOEt group:

The carbonyl is part of COOEt. The ethyl group has 5 H (CH2CH3). The OCH2CH3 has 2 CH2 H and 3 CH3 H. Wait:

COOCH2CH3: The methylene (OCH2) is next to oxygen, and the ethyl is -CH2CH3. So this COOEt group as a whole would contribute:

The COO would have no H, the ethyl group has 5 H (2 from CH2, 3 from CH3).

But in the case of the ester linkage:

The COOEt is -O-C(=O)-O-CH2CH3? No, that's an ether. Wait, actually ester is R-O-C(=O)-R'. So in para-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester, the structure is:

NH2-C6H4-O-C(=O)-OCH2CH3? Wait, no. Wait, I think I got confused. Benzoic acid is C6H5COOH. The ester would be C6H5COOEt, that's correct. So the structure is: the benzene ring connected to a COOEt group, i.e., benzene-C(=O)-O-Et. Para-aminobenzoic acid would have NH2 on the para position relative to the COOEt. So the structure would be NH2 attached to the benzene ring, in the para position relative to the COOEt group. Then the molecular formula would be:

Benzen ring (6C) + COOEt (2C, from the OEt) and the carbonyl carbon. Wait:

COOEt is -COOCH2CH3. So that adds one C (the carbonyl C) plus 2C from the ethyl. So total from COOEt: 3 C (but one is already part of the carboxylic acid). Wait, no. The original benzoic acid has C6H5-COOH, which is 7 C. Then replacing the -OH of the COOH with OEt (ethyl group), so COOEt is a substituent. So the total carbons would be 6 (benzene) + 2 (COO from the acid: 1 C from COOH becomes COOEtd? Wait, maybe it's better to think that the entire molecule as follows:

In para-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester:

The benzene ring (6 C) with -NH2 (para) and -COOEt (para). The COOEt group has -COO (from the original COOH replacing the -OH with -O-Et).

COOEt includes the oxygen from the original COOH, so the carbonyl is part of the COOEt.

So the carbonyl carbon is part of the benzene ring substituent. So total carbons would be:

6 (benzene) + 1 (COOEt’s carbonyl carbon) + 2 (ethyl) + 1 (NH2 as a substituent, but technically. Wait, nitrogen here is in the NH2 group, so no carbon). So total 6 +1 +2=9 carbons. Yes, which matches C9H11NO2.

Hydrogens: Benzene ring with two substituents (para) has 4 H.

NH2 group has 2 H.

COOEt group: the ester’s -OCH2CH3 has 5 H (written as 2 in OCH2 and 3 in CH3).

Then the carbonyl group has no H.

But wait, maybe let me count in detail:

For para-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester:

Benzene ring with NH2 and COOEt.

Benzene para-substituted with two groups. Each substituent is ortho, meta to the other. The H on the benzene ring would be 4 (since with two substituents, each blocking two positions, leaving two pairs of H).

Then the NH2 group: -NH2 has 2 H.

The COOEt group: O=C-O-CH2CH3. Oxygen is adjacent to the carbonyl. The ethyl group (OCH2CH3) has 2+3=5 H.

So adding those up: 4 (benzene) + 2 (NH2) + 5 (OCH2CH3) = 11 H in total. C9H11NO2 matches. Nitrogen is from NH2. O is 2 from COO. Yes, so the molecular formula adds up. That seems correct.

Let's see how the spectral data fit this structure.

First, IR: 

- Two NH stretching vibrations at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Amines (primary) usually have two bands in that region (asymmetric and symmetric stretching). So the NH2 being a primary amine would have those two peaks.

But sometimes in aromatic amines (aniline derivatives), if the NH is para to electron-withdrawing groups (like the ester), the N-H stretches can be broad. But since it's para, perhaps the electron-withdrawing effects are less than meta.

- The strong carbonyl peak at 1720 cm-1 is consistent with an ester (as in the acronym).

Now, the NMR data:

- 1.20 ppm (t, 3H): the ethyl ester's methyl group (CH2CH3) as a triplet. Typically, in an ethyl ester, the methyl is a triplet around 1.2-1.4 ppm as it's next to the OCH2. The splitting comes from the adjacent CH2, which would have two protons, leading to a triplet (n+1 where n=2).

- 4.5 ppm (q, 2H): the OCH2CH3 group. The OCH2 is adjacent to the methyl, hence a quartet (as each proton on OCH2 couples with the three protons of the methyl group, but actually in an ethyl ester split, the OCH2 is a quartet from the adjacent CH3). Wait, hold on. Normally in an ethyl ester (e.g., CH3CH2OCO...):

The ethyl group is propionyl, so the OCH2 is adjacent to the carbonyl. The OCH2 would have a quartet, as each of the two H on OCH2 is coupled with the two H on the adjacent CH2 (wait, no. Wait an ethyl group is OCH2CH3, so the OCH2 is adjacent to the CH3, but that's three H. The OCH2 protons would be split into a quartet (since the neighboring CH3 has 3 H, hence n=3. So splitting would be n+1=4, quartets. But in practice, the ester OCH2 is usually a quartet! So if OCH2CH3 is present, then quartet (4.2-4.5 ppm?) for OCH2, and triplet for CH3.

Yes, so in the given NMR data: CH3 (1.20 ppm, triplet) and OCH2 quartet at 4.5 ppm. That fits ethyl ester's resonances.

Then the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H). That's the NH2 group. But wait, NH2 protons in para-aminobenzoate ester would be deshielded and split by coupling with the adjacent ring protons? Or maybe exchange broadened. If it's on the benzene ring, adjacent to the ester group. However, coupling with the ring might not cause splitting. However, NH2 groups can be broad even in aromatic amines, as the protons can exchange with any moisture in the sample. Alternatively, perhaps they're exchanging with each other, causing a broad singlet. So the 4.0 ppm, broad singlet (2H) matches the NH2 group. However, typically the NH2 protons in aniline derivatives are around 3-4 ppm, and sometimes as high as 5 ppm if deshielded, but in para substitution, perhaps lower. Let me check typical shifts. Wait, in para-substituted aniline derivatives, the NH2 protons might be upfield-shifted compared to meta or ortho. For example, in para-nitroaniline, the NH2 protons are around 6.5 ppm, but that's with strong EWG. In less electron-withdrawing groups (like ester), the shift is around 4-5 ppm? Alternatively, perhaps the NH2 is next to the ester group and is deprotonated? No, if it's NH2, it's still a primary amine. Wait, perhaps the NH2 is undergoing exchange broadening. The broad singlet suggests that or that the protons are equivalent and possibly exchanging. For pure NH2 (unsubstituted) in aniline, those protons may typically appear around 3-4 ppm, but split certain because of coupling to the ring protons, but if it's slightly acidic, perhaps in DMSO-d6 or another solvent, it might be broad. The data here shows 4.0 ppm, broad, 2H. So that could fit the NH2 group.

Then, the aromatic protons. 7.0 ppm, doublet, 2H, and 8.0 ppm doublet, 2H. Wait, that's suggestive of a para-substituted benzene ring with two protons in one environment and two in another. If the substituents are in the para positions (NH2 and COOEt), then the aromatic protons would be two sets of doublets, each coupling with their adjacent protons. Let me visualize. Let's say the benzene has substituents in the para positions (positions 1 and 4):

Substituent at 1 (NH2) and substituent at 4 (COOEt). Then the protons at positions 2 and 3 are equivalent (and their equivalents mirroring around the ring: positions 6 and 5?), leading o two sets of two equivalent protons. For a para-disposed di-substituent benzene, you get two doublets each integrally of two H. Each proton pair next to the substituent (ortho) being deshielded and para being more shielded. In nitro or ester groups, which are strong electron-withdrawing, the ortho and para protons would be deshielded. However, in this case, one substituent is NH2 (electron-donating via resonance but actually gets a activating group for substitution in some cases?) – wait, but direct substitution.

Actually, wait: let's clarify whether ortho and meta to the substituents. If the substituents are para to each other, then the ring's protons are split into two groups: those adjacent to each substituent (i.e., ortho to NH2 and COOEt) and those meta. Wait, maybe your signal breakdown.

But in this case, the NMR shows a doublet at 7.0 (2H) and a doublet at 8.0 (2H), which implies coupling between two pairs. So there are two sets of equivalent aromatic protons, each a pair.

So in the case of para substitution of NH2 and COOEt, then on the ring, the two substituents would split the remaining 4 H into two pairs each. Which would be opposite each other. For example, positions 2/6 (ortho to NH2, meta to COOEt) and positions 3/5 (meta to NH2, ortho to COOEt). Wait, but that can’t give pairs, or if substituents are opposite (para), perhaps the protons at ortho and para would each come in pairs. Alternatively, let's think of it. Imagine the ring with substituents at positions 1 (NH2) and 4 (COOEt).

Then positions 2 and 6 are ortho to NH2 and meta to COOEt. Similarly, positions 3 and 5 are ortho to COOEt and meta to NH2.

The coupling between the ortho and meta protons would lead to doublets for each set. Therefore, the four protons would split into two pairs. Those two protons adjacent to the NH2 (positions 2 and 6) and those adjacent to the COOEt (positions 3 and 5). Each pair would have a different chemical shift due to the different substituents.

The protons adjacent to the NH2 (EDG) may be shielded, hence downfield or upfield? Wait, NH2 is electron-donating via resonance, but -O-CO-OEt is electron-withdrawing. Wait, the COOEt group is electron-withdrawing (ester group). The NH2, as an amino group, is a strong activating group, donating electron into the ring through resonance. But para positions. So the substituents being in para positions would cause the two substituent's electronic effects to perhaps clash? Actually, nitro is meta-directing, but NH2 is ortho/para-directing. Depending on the groups, the positions could influence the electron-withdrawing of the COOEt. But above positioning would have the NH2 in para to the COOEt.

Chemically, how would that influence the NMR shifts?

The protons ortho to the NH2 (positions 2 and 6) would experience more electron-donating effect, making their environment more shielded, hence upfield. Conversely, the protons ortho to the COOEt (EWG), positions 3 and 5, would be deshielded and may appear at higher ppm.

But in the data provided, the lower ppm (7.0 ppm) is the former and the higher (8.0 ppm) is the latter. Confirming that the protons ortho to COOEt (an EWG which deshields) are at 8.0 ppm, as expected, and those ortho to the EDG (NH2) are at 7.0. So that matches the doublets.

But wait, we're seeing a doublet at 7.0 (2H) and 8.0 (2H). Also, note that the coupling for para-substituted benzene where cross-coupling between the two sets occurs. Each proton pair would couple with their neigbors. For instance, the protons at positions 2 and 6 could couple to the protons at positions 3 and 5? Since they're adjacent. Therefore, this would double double doublets, but in which substituted pattern? Well, for a para-substituted diaryl, symmetry would cause each equivalent pair to resonate as a single doublet. 

Another example is 4-ethyl benzoic acid ethyl ester would have... However, let's check actual substituent effects.

Alternatively, perhaps the COOEt is a strong enough EWG to deshield the adjacent (ortho) protons, shifting them downfield. Then the NH2 would act as an EDG, shielding the adjacent (ortho) protons. So: 

Protons ortho to COOEt (an EWG) → downfield (8.0 ppm)

Protons ortho to NH2 (EDG) → upfield (7.0 ppm)

So the downfield doublet is 8.0 (2H) and the upfield doublet is 7.0 (2H). 

The splitting in each doublet would be due to coupling between adjacent protons (i.e., each proton on position 2 couples with position 3 and vice versa). Therefore, each pair would show a doublet of doublets? However, because of symmetry, they're equivalent. Therefore, para substitution on the benzoe would have the two sets of protons: each split into a doublet because each is adjacent to one diad among the substituents.

Alternatively, maybe the coupling between the two sets of protons is what's allowing the NMR observation. For example, the upfield protons (7.0 ppm) and downfield ones (8.0) are each part of a spin system where two protons each see two equivalent neighbors. But perhaps in reality, due to symmetry, these can form two distinct doublet signals. Let's just accept that, as per the data. The NMR looking at two doublets for two groups of aromatic H's fits the structure where substituents are para.

Therefore, all the data points to para-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester.

Alternative interpretations.

Suppose instead of a ester, if it's something else. Could it be an acetanilide with an ethyl group? For example, N-acetylated something.

But the presence of a strong NH2 (two peaks) would conflict with an acetanilide, which has an NH which usually peaks as singh. For example, acetanilide (the NH is shifted upfield as an amide), and has a sharp singlet. Or broad depending on the substitution. But if we have different functional groups.

Alternatively, could there be an oxazole or other ring structure with a carbonyl, but that's complicating things.

Alternatively, seeing the degrees of unsaturation left. The formula's DOU is 5: benzene (3) + carbonyl (1) + another double bond or ring. But in the case of para-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester, what is another DOU? Or wait, the actual DOU: 5 calculated earlier. So benzene (3), carbonyl (1), and another ring. OR maybe ethyl group is part of a ring? Or the NH2 group is part of a ring? However, amido group- but then again, in the given data, NH2 as a substituent would suffice.

Alternatively, check if the ester is in another position. Whether the substituents are not para but meta. But that would result in a different pattern in the NMR.

But given the two doublets, the substituents are likely para. Because in meta substitution, you get a different splitting pattern.

As per the data, the compound must contain an ethyl ester, an NH2 group (amine), a benzene ring with two substituents (likely para), and the carbonyl from the ester.

This is all supportive of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Which is para-aminobenzoic acid, ethyl ester. The common name for this compound is Benzocaine, but let me confirm.

Wait, Benzocaine, if I'm not mistaken, is the ethyl ester of para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA). Benzocaine is indeed C9H11NO2.  Structure draws as: benz ring with -NH2 and -COOEt in para positions.

Yes, that's right. So as per all the spectral data, this would be Benzocaine (Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate).

Alternatively, might need to see if any other possibilities.

Another possibility: methyl ester? But the molecular formula is C9H11NO2, which for benzoic acid methyl ester would still be lower. So ethyl ester is necessary.

The IR has: Nh2 two peaks, and 1720 cm-1 for carbonyl. NMR data lined up with ethyl ester and aromatic NH2.

Therefore, the structure is Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate (Benzocaine). Hence the answer is Benzocaine.
