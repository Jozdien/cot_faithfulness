To determine the energy difference required to clearly resolve two quantum states with energies \(E_1\) and \(E_2\) and lifetimes \(10^{-9}\) seconds and \(10^{-8}\) seconds respectively, we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The energy uncertainty (ΔE) of a state is given by:

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau}
\]

where \(\hbar\) is the reduced Planck constant (\(\approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\)) and \(\tau\) is the lifetime of the state.

For the first state with \(\tau_1 = 10^{-9}\) seconds:
\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}}{10^{-9} \, \text{s}} \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J}
\]
Converting to electronvolts (1 eV = \(1.602176634 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}\)):
\[
\Delta E_1 \approx \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-25}}{1.602176634 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
\]

For the second state with \(\tau_2 = 10^{-8}\) seconds:
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}}{10^{-8} \, \text{s}} \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}
\]
Converting to electronvolts:
\[
\Delta E_2 \approx \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-26}}{1.602176634 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.58 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}
\]

To clearly resolve the two energy levels, their energy difference should be greater than the sum of their uncertainties:
\[
\Delta E_{\text{total}} = \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 \approx 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} + 6.58 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \approx 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
\]

Thus, the energy difference should be at least on the order of \(10^{-6} \, \text{eV}\) to ensure clear resolution.

\[
\boxed{10^{-6} \text{ eV}}
\]

# R1 reasoning

Alright, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, the question is about distinguishing two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are given as 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to figure out what their energy difference should be so that we can clearly resolve them. The options aren't listed here, but I guess I need to recall the principles that determine the resolvability of energy levels based on their lifetimes.

Okay, first things first. I remember that the uncertainty principle relates the lifetime of a state to the uncertainty in its energy. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is at least h/(4π), where h is Planck's constant. The formula is ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2, sometimes written with ħ (h-bar) where ħ = h/(2π), so substituting that in, ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2 would become ΔE * Δt ≥ h/(4π).

In this problem, the lifetimes of the states are given. Lifetime is related to the time uncertainty, right? So Δt is the lifetime of the state. For each energy level, the energy uncertainty (or the width of the energy level) can be found using ΔE ≈ ħ / (2Δt). Wait, let me check that. Since the uncertainty principle is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, solving for ΔE gives ΔE ≈ ħ/(2Δt). Let me verify that...

Yes, if ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, then ΔE ≈ ħ/(2Δt). So for each state, we can compute the energy width. If we have two energy levels with different lifetimes, their energy widths would be different. To resolve them clearly, the energy difference between them (ΔE_total = |E2 - E1|) should be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties, perhaps? Or maybe the combined width from both energy levels.

Wait, actually, when you're trying to resolve two spectral lines, the criterion is usually that the separation between the peaks should be greater than the sum of their linewidths. If the peaks overlap too much, you can't distinguish them. So the linewidth for each energy level is given by the energy uncertainty ΔE. So the natural linewidth for each state would be ΔE1 = ħ/(2Δt1) and ΔE2 = ħ/(2Δt2). Then the total linewidth might be the sum of these two? Or perhaps you take the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of each, and the resolution condition depends on how the peaks compare.

Alternatively, some sources say that two spectral lines can be resolved if their separation is greater than the half-width of each line. Hmm. Maybe the Rayleigh criterion? In optics, the Rayleigh criterion states that two sources are just resolved when the central maximum of one diffraction pattern coincides with the first minimum of the other. For spectral lines with a Lorentzian profile (which is the case for natural broadening due to finite lifetime), the Rayleigh criterion isn't exactly applicable because the Lorentzian doesn't have minima like the Airy disk. However, another approach is to consider that the peaks are resolvable if their separation is greater than the sum of their half-widths. 

Alternatively, maybe we just consider that the energy difference should be larger than the uncertainty in the energy difference, which would come from the uncertainties of both states. So ΔE_total = |E2 - E1| should be greater than the sum of the individual uncertainties, sqrt((ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2) depending on how uncertainties propagate. Wait, but in reality, each energy level contributes an uncertainty to its own energy. When you're measuring the difference between two energies, the total uncertainty would be the square root of the sum of the squares of the individual uncertainties.

So the minimum energy difference required to resolve them would be greater than or equal to the combined uncertainty. Let me formalize that.

If the energy of each state has an uncertainty ΔE1 and ΔE2, then the uncertainty in their difference would be sqrt( (ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2 ), assuming the uncertainties are independent. Therefore, the energy difference must be greater than this combined uncertainty to be resolvable.

But in practical terms, maybe they just say that the energy separation should be larger than the sum of the individual linewidths, so that the peaks don't overlap. However, different conventions could be mentioned here.

In any case, my first step is to calculate the individual energy uncertainties (ΔE1 and ΔE2) using the given lifetimes.

Given:

Δt1 = 10^-9 seconds

Δt2 = 10^-8 seconds

Compute ΔE1 = ħ / (2Δt1)

ΔE2 = ħ / (2Δt2)

But ħ is approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s

However, energy is often expressed in electronvolts (eV) in such contexts, so I should convert the result into eV.

First, compute ΔE1 and ΔE2 in Joules, then convert to eV.

Let’s recall that 1 eV = 1.602176634×10^-19 J. So, after calculating in Joules, divide by 1.602176634×10^-19 to get eV.

Let’s compute ħ/(2Δt):

First, calculate ħ/(2Δt1):

Δt1=1e-9 s

So, ΔE1= (1.0545718e-34 J·s)/(2*1e-9 s) = 1.0545718e-34 / 2e-9 = 5.272859e-26 J

Convert to eV: 5.272859e-26 / 1.602176634e-19 ≈ 3.29e-7 eV

Similarly for Δt2=1e-8 s:

ΔE2= (1.0545718e-34)/(2*1e-8) = 1.0545718e-34 / 2e-8 = 5.272859e-27 J

Convert to eV: 5.272859e-27 /1.602176634e-19 ≈ 3.29e-8 eV

So, the energy uncertainties are approximately 3.29e-7 eV for the first state (lifetime 1e-9 s) and 3.29e-8 eV for the second state (lifetime 1e-8 s). 

Wait, let me check that calculation again:

Wait, wait That can’t be right because ΔE1 is the state with the shorter lifetime (1e-9 s) => larger energy uncertainty, but the numbers I computed above have ΔE1 as 3.29e-7 eV and ΔE2 as 3.29e-8 eV, which seems correct, since shorter lifetime means larger energy uncertainty. 10^-9 is smaller than 10^-8, so 1/(10^-9) is larger. So yes, ΔE1 should be larger.

So the energy uncertainties are approximately 0.329 microelectronvolt (μeV) for ΔE1 and 0.0329 μeV for ΔE2.

So sum of these uncertainties would be roughly 0.329 + 0.0329 = ~0.362 μeV.

The combined uncertainty, if we take the square root of the sum of squares, is sqrt((0.329)^2 + (0.0329)^2 ) μeV ≈ sqrt(0.108 + 0.00108) ≈ sqrt(0.109) ≈ 0.33 μeV.

Wait, that’s sort of inconsistent. Because normally, for independent uncertainties, it would be sqrt( a² + b² ). But maybe in this context, when you have two energy levels contributing to the linewidth, what's the standard approach?

Actually, the linewidth of a transition between two energy levels is given by the sum of the widths of each level. For example, the natural linewidth of a transition is Γ = Γ1 + Γ2, where Γ1 and Γ2 are the widths of the two levels. Each Γ is equal to ħ divided by the lifetime. Wait, but in my previous calculation, we calculated each delta E as ħ/(2Δt), but maybe the natural linewidth Γ is actually equal to ħ/Δt. Let me verify this.

Yes, this is confusion in the definition. From what I remember, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle is often written ΔE Δt ≈ ħ, so maybe Γ (the linewidth) is ΔE = ħ/Δt. Let me confirm with some references.

The energy-time uncertainty principle is often stated as ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2. But depending on the precise definitions, sometimes you see ΔE Δt ≈ ħ. For natural line broadening, the lifetime τ (delta t) is related to the linewidth (FWHM) of the spectral line as ΔE = ħ / τ. So here, Γ = ħ / τ. Hence, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the Lorentzian distribution is Γ.

Hence, if that is the case, then Γ1 = ħ / τ1 and Γ2 = ħ / τ2, where τ1 and τ2 are the lifetimes. Then, in a transition between two states, the total linewidth would be Γ_total = Γ1 + Γ2. Wait, but actually, when two energy levels each have a finite lifetime, the linewidth of the transition is the sum of the individual linewidths. So if the upper state has a lifetime τ_upper and the lower state has τ_lower, then the transition linewidth Γ = Γ_upper + Γ_lower = ħ (1/τ_upper + 1/τ_lower).

Wait, let me check that. In spectroscopy, if you have an excited state with a finite lifetime τ, the emitted photon will have a linewidth Γ = ħ / τ (actually, Γ is usually represented as the angular frequency linewidth, so Γ = 1/τ with units of radians per second). Then ΔE = ħ Γ = ħ / τ (since Γ = 1/τ). Therefore, ΔE = ħ / τ.

Hence, for the transition between two states each with a finite lifetime, the linewidth is the sum of the individual contributions from each state. So Γ_total = Γ1 + Γ2 = (ħ / τ1) + (ħ / τ2).

Therefore, the energy uncertainty (linewidth) of the transition would be (assuming lower state lifetime τ1 and upper state lifetime τ2, but actually, when you have a transition, the upper state's lifetime is usually what's considered, but if both have finite lifetimes, then it's both.)

But in the problem, we are not considering a transition. The question is about distinguishing the energies of the two states themselves, not the transition between them. Wait, hold on. If the two energy levels have different energies E1 and E2, then how do you observe them?

In spectroscopy, you observe transitions between energy levels. So you typically probe a transition from a ground state to an excited state, but in that case, the linewidth would depend primarily on the excited state's lifetime, as the ground state is often stable (lifetime is long, linewidth is negligible). However, some experiments might involve transitions between two excited states, each with their own finite lifetimes.

Alternatively, if you are measuring the energies of individual states through some other method, like electronic energy levels in a quantum dot probed by some tunneling experiment where the lifetime is determined by the tunneling rates. Then, the energy uncertainty is given by the lifetime of each individual state.

But onto the problem: the question is about distinguishing the two energy levels, so assuming that each has an energy uncertainty (broadening) due to their finite lifetimes. To resolve two peaks in a spectrum (whether it's an emission spectrum, absorption spectrum, or some other measurement), the energy difference should be larger than the combined broadening of both levels.

Assuming that the broadening is due to the lifetimes of the respective states, then each energy level is broadened by Γ1 = ħ / τ1 and Γ2 = ħ / τ2.

Therefore, to resolve them as separate peaks, the energy separation ΔE = |E2 - E1| should be greater than the sum of Γ1 and Γ2 (if the peaks are assumed to be separated by more than their combined widths), or greater than the convolution of their line shapes.

However, this might be approximated as ΔE > Γ1 + Γ2.

Alternatively, a standard resolution criterion might require ΔE > (Γ1 + Γ2)/2 or something else. But given that the problem is using wording "clearly resolved", it might just mean that the energy separation is larger than the sum of the uncertainties. But to get a definitive answer, we might have to follow a standard approach.

However, different sources can say different things here. Let me recall natural linewidth: Natural linewidth is given by the lifetime of the excited state since the ground state is typically stable. So, in that case, Γ = ħ / τ. Therefore, when you have two energy levels with different lifetimes, if you're considering their individual uncertainties, then Γ1 = ħ / τ1, Γ2 = ħ / τ2. If the two levels are being measured by transitions from another state, say each has transitions from a common ground state, then their linewidths would be determined by their respective upper state lifetimes. However, if the two energy levels are in a system where they can transition between each other, the linewidth of that transition would be Γ1 + Γ2. But this is getting into details beyond the problem's scope.

Sticking to the question: What energy difference allows to clearly resolve the two energy levels? Since each has an uncertainty in energy from their lifetimes. To resolve them, their energy difference should be larger than the sum of the uncertainties.

So, compute Γ1 and Γ2, sum them up, and the energy difference should be greater than this sum.

Alternatively, maybe take the largest of the two uncertainties? But since there are two methods:

If we need the energy difference to be larger than the broadening of each state summed, or use another criterion. But let's proceed.

First, compute Γ1 and Γ2:

Γ1 = ħ / τ1

Γ2 = ħ / τ2

But given τ1=1e-9 s and τ2=1e-8 s,

So Γ1 = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) = 1.0545718e-25 J

Γ2 = (1.0545718e-34) / (1e-8) = 1.0545718e-26 J

Convert to eV:

Γ1 = 1.0545718e-25 J / 1.602176634e-19 J/eV ≈ 6.58e-7 eV

Γ2 = 1.0545718e-26 J / 1.602176634e-19 ≈ 6.58e-8 eV

Then Γ1 + Γ2≈6.58e-7 +6.58e-8 ≈7.24e-7 eV, i.e., approximately 0.724 μeV.

Therefore, to resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference must be greater than this sum, so they need to be at least around 0.724 μeV apart.

But let's check with another approach. If the energies are considered with Gaussian uncertainties, the combined FWHM would perhaps be sqrt(Γ1^2 + Γ2^2), but that would depend on different line shapes. But if the line shapes are Lorentzian (as in natural broadening), adding FWHMs isn't additive but the convolution of Lorentzians is a Lorentzian with FWHM equal to sum of the widths. So in that case, the transition between two levels each with Γ1 and Γ2 would have a line shape with Γ = Γ1 + Γ2.

Therefore, if we are trying to resolve two energy levels (as separate), each has an energy spread Γ1 and Γ2. So separated by at least (Γ1 + Γ2)/2? Wait, if the question is about resolving peaks in a spectrum, which have Lorentzian profiles with widths Γ1 and Γ2, then for them to be resolved, the separation should be greater than the average width. For example, Rayleigh criterion states that two peaks are resolved if they are separated by their FWHM. But since the Rayleigh criterion is for diffraction-limited spots, while in Lorentzians, the peaks don't have minima. So, if you have two Lorentzians with widths Γ1 and Γ2 separated by at least their average width, they might be considered resolved.

Alternatively, another method is called the "sparsity criterion," where the separation between the peaks should be greater than the FWHM.

But I think for the problem's purpose, it's safest to proceed with the combined uncertainty approach. If we consider both uncertainties, Γ1 and Γ2, so the energy levels cannot be determined more precisely than those uncertainties. Therefore, to resolve them, their energy difference must be larger than the combination of their uncertainties.

If we take the sum Γ1 + Γ2 = 7.24e-7 eV ≈ 0.72 μeV, then the energy difference must be at least on that order or higher to be distinguishable. Therefore, any energy difference higher than ~1 μeV would certainly be resolvable, whereas energy differences lower than that may not be. 

Looking at possible answer options, if given in eV or μeV, the right choice would be greater than ~1e-6 eV (1 μeV). For options such as 10^-4 eV, which is 100 μeV, 10^-5 eV=10 μeV, and 10^-6 eV=1 μeV, then it would need to be at least 10^-6 eV. If the problem's options are 10^-5 eV, 10^-6 eV, etc., the answer is the one just larger than 0.7 micro eV, so 1e-6 eV would work.

Alternatively, if 1e-4 eV which is 100 μeV, then that's much larger even sum, so it can be resolved.

So if the options include 10^-4 eV, that would definitely work, but given that when I computed the sum is ~0.7 micro eV, which is ~7e-7 eV=0.7e-6 eV=7*1e-7. So if the options are:

A. 10^-4 eV (100 μeV)

B. 10^-5 eV (10 μeV)

C. 10^-6 eV (1 μeV)

D. 10^-7 eV (0.1 μeV)

Then the answer would be C or higher. Since 0.7e-6 eV is the limit, so 1e-6 eV=1 μeV is sufficient, but 10^-7 eV is insufficient.

But maybe the question wants here to just take the largest of the two uncertainties instead of sum. Γ1 ~0.66 μeV and Γ2 ~0.066 μeV, so sum is ~0.726 μeV and quadratically combined is sqrt(0.66^2 +0.066^2)= ~0.664 which isn't much.

Alternatively, some sources might strictly use the lower state's lifetime (say, assuming the lower energy level has a much longer lifetime, but here E2 is stated to have a longer lifetime (10^-8 sec) compared to E1's 10^-9 sec). However, if no one state is a ground state with infinite lifetime, then both need to be considered.

But in the given problem, the problem is not specifying whether it's a transition between the two states. It's about resolving the two energy levels themselves. Therefore, if in the experiment we are measuring energies with precision such that each state's energy is uncertainty broadened by their respective lifetimes. Then, the energy resolution required to distinguish them would have to surpass the combined uncertainty.

Alternatively, perhaps think that the energy resolution would need to be such that the measured peak positions are separated by more than their full width at half maximum. So for each state's energy line to be resolvable (if you have delta peaks convolved with lorentzians of different widths), the separation should exceed their widths.

Wait, but in reality, when measuring the energies of two states that don't transition to each other, like if each can be excited from a common ground state. Then each energy transition (from ground to E1 and ground to E2) would have linewidths determined by their excited state's lifetime (assuming ground state is stable). But here, we aren't told anything about transitions, just their own energies.

Alternatively, considering linewidths from resonant scattering experiments or other measurements. But without knowledge of the exact experiment, but here it's just a general question.

As a possible summary, if the lifetimes are τ1 and τ2, then the uncertainties in their energies are ΔE1= ħ / τ1 and ΔE2= ħ / τ2. The total uncertainty of the difference would be roughly the sum of the uncertainties (if correlated) or combined in quadrature (?).

Assuming they are uncorrelated, the uncertainty would be sqrt( (ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2 ). So sqrt( (0.6e-6 eV)^2 + (0.06e-6 eV)^2 ) ≈ 0.6e-6 eV. Hence, if the energy difference is larger than this, they can be resolved.

But the problem states: "clearly distinguish these two energy levels". Depending on if "clearly" is a keyword here. To clearly resolve, might want separation multiple times the uncertainty. For instance, 5 times the uncertainty. But the problem refers to options, but since we don't have them, we have to assume based on the choice.

Since our calculation gives a combined uncertainty around 0.7 μeV, then the answer options would need to have energy differences larger than this. Therefore, possible candidate is 10^-6 eV (1 μeV=1e-6 eV) and above.

Alternatively, in some references, they use ΔE ≈ ħ / τ.

Given that, the energies must differ by at least max( ΔE1, ΔE2 )?

ΔE1= ~1e-25 J / e-19 = ~1e-6 eV)

ΔE1 converted is 6.58e-7 eV (approx 0.658e-6 eV=0.658 μeV)

ΔE2= ~1e-26 J converted is 6.58e-8 eV=approx0.0658 μeV.

Thus, the larger uncertainty is ~0.658 μeV (ΔE1). So their separation needs to be larger than this.

Depending on which criterion is used, either 1 μeV might suffice (which is ~1.5 ΔE1), and since it's ask for "clearly resolved", the order of the energy difference should be larger than the uncertainty.

However, given that lifetime leads to a natural linewidth of the energy of each state. If you measure energy E1 and E2, each has a distribution around their mean values with widths ΔE1 and ΔE2. To resolve these as distinct peaks, the separation between E1 and E2 should be larger than the sum of their standard deviations (if considering Gaussian), but since these are Lorentzian, maybe again the sum applies. But most importantly, depending on conventions.

But maybe the problem is considering the Fourier limit. Perhaps ΔE must be greater than ħ/(Δt), where Δt is the lifetime subset?

Wait, maybe I overshot a step. Let me check another way: When a system exists in a quantum state for an average time τ (the lifetime), the energy of that state cannot be defined more precisely than ΔE ≈ ħ/(2τ), applying the uncertainty principle. Therefore, the energy uncertainty for each state is given by this ΔE.

Therefore, for two states, to be clearly resolved, the energy difference ΔE_total must be greater than the sum of their individual uncertainties ΔE1 + ΔE2.

As we calculated, their sum is around 0.724 μeV=7.24e-7 eV.

Therefore, so their energy difference ΔE_total needs to be larger than ~7.24e-7 eV=0.724 μeV. So, The smallest ΔE_total that allows resolving here is what's necessary, hence the answer should be greater than approximately 0.7 μeV.

But the usual practice for resolvability is based on a specific criterion. For example, the full width at half maximum (FWHM). For two peaks to be resolved, their separation should be greater than their FWHM. If their sum of FWHM is Γ_total = Γ1 + Γ2, then to resolve, ΔE >= Γ_total.

Therefore, ≡ Hence，the correct energy difference should be greater than Γ_total which is (ħ / τ1 + ħ / τ2 ) = ħ (1/(1e-9) + 1/(1e-8)) = ħ (1e9 + 1e8) = ħ (1.1e9)

But when converted into numerical value:

Γ_total = 1.0545718e-34 Js * (1.1e9 1/s) = 1.16e-25 J. Then converting into eV:

1.16e-25 / 1.602e-19 ≈7.25e-7 eV≈0.725 μeV. 

Therefore, choosing an energy difference larger than 0.725 μeV would allow clear resolution. Hence, if the options include 1 μeV probably as the closest higher value compared to 0.725 μeV.

But according to normal options, perhaps the answer is ħ/(τ1) ≈ 0.659 μeV (ignoring the second term). But as we see, the other term, though ten times smaller, still contributes. So, in total, about 0.7 μeV also.

Looking back but options given are likely 10^-4 eV (100 μeV), 10^-5 eV (10 μeV), 10^-6 eV (1 μeV), and 10^-7 eV (0.1 μeV). So 10^-6 eV=1 μeV is larger than ~0.7 μeV, so generalization is that the answer is 10^-6 eV. Another way, some lectures or textbooks may say that the distinguishability requires ΔE > h/(2πτ), but not the sum. Even if there's uncertainty from both states, the question asks which "could be their energy difference". If the correct answer is based on the minimum of the two lifetimes (most significant uncertainty), hence 10^-9 sec is τ1, giving ħ/(tau1) as the key term. τ1 = Smaller lifetime τ1=1e-9 gives the broader linewidth. Therefore if the answer loosely uses ΔE≈ħ/tau, and just use the biggest deltaE,  using hte smallest tau, then deltaE≈1e-25 J =7e-7 eV≈0.7 μeV.

So approximately 1 μeV. So an answer would be 10^-6 eV or 1 μeV. Hence, if given the options, 1e-6秒ev ... Nevertheless the selection of the answer bases the sum of linewidths. So based on the calculation, possibly 1e-6 eV. For the problem, we need to box an answer, but since the options aren't given here, but based on the majority of calculations concluding ~1e-6 eV is required, so

**Final Answer**
The energy difference should be at least on the order of \boxed{10^{-6} \text{ eV}}.
