# Original Question

A methanol solution of (R)-(+)-Limonene is stirred with Pd/C under a Hydrogen atmosphere. After 1 equivalent of hydrogen is consumed, product 1 is isolated as the major product.

1 is treated with 3-chloroperbenzoic acid, forming product 2.

Product 2 is treated with sodium methoxide, forming product 3.

Product 3 is treated with propanoic acid, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. and a catalytic amount of  4-dimethylaminopyridine, forming product 4.

what is a valid structure of product 4? (product 4 exists as a mixture of isomers. the correct answer is one of them).

# R1 response

The given reactions involve several transformations starting with (R)-(+)-Limonene. Here is the breakdown of each step and the final product:

1. **Hydrogenation of (R)-(+)-Limonene**: (R)-(+)-Limonene is a cyclic monoterpene with one double bond in the cyclohexene ring and another in the isopropenyl group. Hydrogenation with Pd/C and H₂ adds one equivalent of hydrogen, saturating the more reactive exocyclic double bond (isopropenyl group) to form an isopropyl group. The product (product 1) is 1-methyl-4-isopropylcyclohex-1-ene.

2. **Epoxidation with mCPBA**: The remaining cyclohexene double bond in product 1 is epoxidized using 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (mCPBA) to form an epoxide (product 2).

3. **Epoxide ring-opening with sodium methoxide**: The epoxide in product 2 undergoes ring-opening in basic conditions (sodium methoxide) to form a trans-diol (product 3). The base-induced ring-opening results in a vicinal diol (1,2-cyclohexanediol) with methyl and isopropyl substituents.

4. **Esterification with propanoic acid**: The diol in product 3 is treated with propanoic acid, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP). This conditions esterifies one of the hydroxyl groups, forming a mixture of isomeric mono-esters (product 4). The major product is the ester where the more accessible hydroxyl group (due to steric factors) reacts with propanoic acid.

The final product, product 4, is a mixture of isomers where one of the hydroxyl groups in the trans-diol is esterified with propanoic acid. One of the valid structures is the propanoate ester of 2-methyl-5-(propionyloxy)cyclohexanol.

\boxed{\text{Propanoate ester of 2-methyl-5-(propionyloxy)cyclohexanol}}

# R1 reasoning

Okay, so I need to figure out the structure of product 4 based on the given reactions. Let's walk through each step one by one. 

Starting with (R)-(+)-Limonene. Limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, right? The (R) configuration means it's the dextrorotatory enantiomer. Structurally, limonene has a bicyclic structure with a cyclohexene ring fused to a cyclopropane ring, or more accurately, a substituted cyclohexene. Wait, let me recall. Limonene has a structure with a cyclohexene ring where there's a methyl group and a substituted propene group. The actual structure is a bicyclic monoterpene, but maybe it's a cyclohexene with two isoprene units? Hmm, perhaps I should sketch it out. 

(R)-Limonene has the methyl groups at specific positions. The (+)-enantiomer is the one where the methyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexene ring. Wait, maybe it's better to think of limonene as a molecule with a structure where there's a cyclohexene ring, with a methyl group at carbon 1 and a isopropylidene group (CH2CH2C(CH2)) at carbon 4, forming a bicyclic structure? Or perhaps I'm mixing it with another terpene.

Wait, no, limonene isn't bicyclic, actually. Wait, no, limonene is 1-methyl-4-prop-1-en-2-ylcyclohex-1-ene. So it's a cyclohexene ring with a methyl group at C1 and a substituted propene group at C4. But let's verify: limonene, the structure is a cyclic monoterpene. The (R) configuration refers to the chiral center. Limonene has two double bonds? Or just one?

Wait, limonene's structure: actually, the structure of limonene is a cyclic monoterpene with one double bond. The carbon skeleton is: it's a cyclohexene ring (so a 6-membered ring with a double bond), with a methyl group at position 1 and a prop-1-en-2-yl group (also called isopropenyl group) at position 4. So the structure can be written as 1-methyl-4-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene. But more commonly depicted with a menthane skeleton?

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Limonene is a bicyclic compound? No. Limonene is a monocyclic monoterpene. Let me get that straight. Let's look up the structure in my mind. Ah, limonene has a cyclohexene ring with two substituents: a methyl group and a (3-methyl-2-butenyl) group. Wait, that might complicate things. Alternatively, limonene can be depicted as an unsymmetrical cyclohexene where at positions 1 and 5 (if numbering around the ring), there are substituents. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that limonene is carvone? No, carvone is different. Alternatively, perhaps it's similar to menthofuran.

Wait, maybe I need to pause and construct limonene step by step. Limonene is (R)-limonene, which is the major component of orange peel oil. Structure-wise, it's a cyclic monoterpene consisting of two isoprene units. The exact structure is a cyclohexene ring with a methyl group at carbon 1 and an isopropylidene group (CH2CH2C(CH2)) at carbon 4, forming a ring. Wait, but maybe the structure is actually this: imagine a six-membered cyclohexene ring, double bond between carbons 1 and 2. At carbon 1, there is a methyl group. At carbon 5 (if the ring is numbered starting at the methyl), there's a three-carbon substituent. No, wait, maybe the isopropenyl group is on the same cyclohexene ring.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's imagine limonene as cyclohexene (1,8-cineol? No, cineole is different). Let me just recall that when limonene is hydrogenated, it typically adds hydrogen across the double bond. The first hydrogenation step with Pd/C and H2 adds one equivalent of hydrogen. Since limonene has one double bond, hydrogenation would convert the cyclohexene into cyclohexane derivative. 

So if limonene's structure is a cyclohexene with substituents, the hydrogenation would add H2 across the double bond, making the saturated cyclohexane ring. Thus, the first step would produce a bicyclic compound where the original double bond is now a single bond. Wait, but limonene is monocyclic. Wait, no—wait, limonene has fused rings? No, limonene has a single ring, a cyclohexene with a substituent that might form a bridge, making it bicyclic?

Wait, maybe I need to remember that limonene has a bicyclic structure. Wait, I think I'm confusing limonene with pinene, which is bicyclic. Pinene has fused cyclohexane and cyclopropane rings? Or a bicyclo[3.1.1]heptane structure. Yeah, alpha-pinene is bicyclo[3.1.1]hept-2-ene. But limonene, on the other hand, is monocyclic. Let me check an online structure in my mind. Limonene: Chemical formula C10H16. Structure is 1-methyl-4-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene. Alternatively, the structure is a cyclohexene ring with a methyl group at one position and a prenyl (CH2CH(CH2)C) group at another.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure for (R)-(+)-limonene is a cyclohexene ring with a methyl group at carbon 1 and a 3-methyl-1,2-butadienyl group at carbon 4. No, more accurately, the substituent should be a propene group attached to the cyclohexene ring.

But perhaps another approach. Let me try drawing it mentally. If limonene is cyclohexene with substituents, hydrogenation would give cyclohexane. Then, maybe the hydrogenation leads to opening of a ring or forming a bridge. Wait, but we start with (R)-limonene, which has a chiral center. Adding hydrogen to the double bond would create another chiral center? Not necessarily. If the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2 of the cyclohexene ring, adding H2 would result in adjacent substituents. Wait, the (R)-configuration is due to the arrangement around the chiral center in limonene. So after hydrogenation, the cyclohexane ring would still retain the methyl group and the isopropyl-like group.

Alternatively, if limonene's structure causes hydrogenation to yield a bicyclic molecule? Hmm. Maybe hydrogenation of limonene converts it into a monocyclic structure. For example, suppose the original limonene has a ring structure where the double bond is part of a bridge. Then hydrogenation would open that? Wait, but limonene's structure is non-bridged. Wait, according to the molecular structure of limonene, it's 1-methyl-4-isopropenylcyclohex-1-ene. So substituting cyclohexene at C1 with methyl and C4 with isopropenyl (CH2C(CH2)).

Once hydrogenated with H2 over Pd/C, the cyclohexene double bond (between C1 and C2) would be saturated, so Product 1 would be 1-methyl-4-isopropylcyclohexane. However, wait, perhaps the cyclohexene would get hydrogenated to cyclohexane, so turning the double bond into a single bond, adding two hydrogens. 

But then how does the configuration change? The original (R)-configuration in limonene would relate to the chiral center formed. Because limonene is (R) at C4, I think. Wait, maybe in limonene, the chiral center is at the carbon attached to the isopropenyl group. The (+)-enantiomer (R) has that configuration. So when hydrogenated, you add H2 to the cyclohexene's double bond. The addition would be syn-addition because Pd/C is a catalyst for hydrogenation, which usually adds in syn fashion. However, when adding H2 to cyclohexene, the actual stereochemistry may depend on the proximity. Let me think.

If the starting material is (R)-limonene, which has a certain arrangement where the isopropenyl group and methyl group are positioned in such a way. Hydrogenation of the cyclohexene would create two new H's. Syn addition would add both hydrogens on the same face. Since the cyclohexene ring is likely to be in a chair conformation, the addition would result in either axial or equatorial hydrogens. But perhaps this leads to a trans or cis decalination. Alternatively, maybe the limonene's original cyclohexene has adjacent substituents (methyl and isopropenyl), and the addition here would lead to specific axial or equatorial positions.

But this is getting too detailed. Let's assume product 1 is 4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohexane, but maybe the hydrogenation gives menthol or something? No, menthol is a monoterpene alcohol. Wait, product 1 isn't an alcohol since the reaction is hydrogenation of limonene. Limonene is a hydrocarbon, so product 1 is the saturated hydrocarbon. So 1-methyl-4-isopropylcyclohexane. Which is also known as menthane, maybe?

Wait, menthane would be decalin, no. Wait, menthane is a bicyclic compound. Hmm. Maybe I'm confused again. The structure of product 1 would just be cyclohexane with methyl and isopropyl groups. Let's note that after hydrogenation of limonene, product 1 would have substituents at positions 1 and 4 of the cyclohexane, both substituents: methyl and isopropyl.

Now, moving on to the next step: treating product 1 with 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (mCPBA), which is an epoxidizing agent. But wait, product 1 is a cyclohexane, which has no double bonds. Wait, but how can a cyclohexane react with mCPBA? Maybe there's confusion here. Wait, no: The first step is hydrogenation of limonene (which is a cyclic monoterpene with one double bond), so hydrogenating that would consume one equivalent of H2 and saturate the double bond. Therefore, product 1 should have no double bonds. However, mCPBA is used for epoxidation of double bonds. That implies that product 1 might still have a double bond. Wait, perhaps the hydrogenation isn't complete? But the problem states after 1 equivalent of H2 is consumed. Limonene has one double bond, so hydrogenation would add one H2 to make it a single bond, so product 1 is fully saturated. Therefore, using mCPBA to epoxidize product 1 wouldn't work because there’s no double bond. Therefore, this might suggest that my initial analysis is wrong. 

Wait, something's inconsistent. Let me check again. If limonene has two double bonds? Wait, no, limonene is a monoterpene with one double bond. The formula is C10H16. Hydrogenation would lead to C10H18. Ok, one double bond adds two H's. But then, how do the next steps make sense? The second step uses mCPBA, which is a peracid and typically used for epoxidation of alkenes. If product 1 has no alkenes, then what's reacting? 

Hence, this suggests that maybe my initial hydrogenation step is wrong, and perhaps in limonene, the hydrogenation didn't fully saturate the ring. But that's conflicting with the first sentence: 1 equivalent is consumed, which for monoterpene (with one double bond) would mean saturation. So maybe limonene has more than one double bond. Let me verify: Limonene (C10H16). Degrees of unsaturation: for C10H16, degrees of unconjugated is 3 (since (2*10 + 2 -16)/2 = (22 -16)/2 = 3). So limonene has three degrees: one ring and two double bonds? Or two rings and one double bond. In either case, since H2 adds one equivalent (assuming one double bond is hydrogenated.

Wait, perhaps limonene has another ring, which is why after different scenarios. But limonene is cyclic monoterpene. So structure would be with two rings? For example, p-mentha-1,5-diene? But limonene is commonly known as 1-methyl-4-isopropenylcyclohex-1-ene. This would have one double bond in the cyclohexene ring. Then, C10H16 corresponds to three degrees of unsaturation: one from the ring (cyclohexene has one ring and one double bond? No, the ring itself doesn't contribute to the double bond. Wait, (C10H16) formula’s degrees of unsaturation: (2*10+2-16)/2 = (22-16)/2 = 3 degrees. So three total: maybe one ring and two double bonds. But limonene, chemically, has one double bond. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a bicyclic structure with one double bond. 

However, I'm getting stuck here. Ultimately, because P1 is formed after one equivalent of H2 consumed, meaning one double bond added. The next step treats P1 with mCPBA to form an epoxide. Therefore, P1 must have a double bond where the epoxidation occurs.

Ah, so this means that limonene must have two double bonds (i.e., diene), but hydrogenation under these conditions selectively hydrogenates one of them, leaving another double bond intact. Then mCPBA would epoxidize that remaining double bond.

Therefore, limonene with two double bonds. Let's consider limonene structure again. Limonene—actually, my confusion comes from maybe that (R)-limonene has a bicyclic structure.

Alternatively, maybe when limonene is hydrogenated, a different alkene is generated?

Wait, maybe limonene is α-phellandrene or similar, which has conjugated dienes. Wait, α-phellandrene is a cyclic monoterpene with two double bonds. Should I check limonene's structure again?

Searching my memory: Limonene's structure is that of a cyclic monoterpene with one double bond. But common names can be confusing. Wait, here's a different approach: 1 equivalent of H2 is consumed during hydrogenation of limonene. That suggests only one double bond is being hydrogenated. Then, mCPBA, which epoxidizes a double bond, is added to product 1. Therefore, product 1 must contain another double bond, which must have been formed during hydrogenation. 

Wait, that seems contradictory. Unless hydrogenation is partial or not complete. But the problem states "after 1 equivalent of hydrogen is consumed." So if limonene has two double bonds and only one is hydrogenated, then permanganate... No, limonene has one double bond, as per chemical formula. Wait, perhaps a different reaction mechanism?

Wait, maybe during hydrogenation of limonene, a ring-opening occurs. For example, since limonene is bicyclic, hydrogenation of one double bond converts it into a monocyclic with a remaining double bond. 

Alternatively, let me recall the structural formula. Looking carefully: limonene has a cyclohexene ring (one double bond) and another double bond in the substituent. Wait, maybe the isopropenyl group (CH2=C(CH3)-) as a substituent. So the cyclohexene ring has a double bond in the ring and the substituent (isopropenyl) has another double bond. Then, total degrees of unsaturation would be 3 (one for cyclohexene ring, one for isopropenyl doublé bond, and two rings. Wait, but cyclohexene replaces one ring.) Hmm.

If limonene has two double bonds: one in the cyclohexene ring and one in the side chain, then hydrogenation with 1 equivalent of H2 would hydrogenate one of them. The Pd/C catalyst usually hydrogenates less substituted double bonds first or more substituted? Hydrogenation selectivity: Typically, more substituted double bonds are more stable but perhaps get hydrogenated slower because of steric hindrance. But this can vary. In limonene, suppose the cyclohexene ring is more substituted (since it's part of a cyclohexene) while the side chain is a less substituted double bond. Thus, under hydrogenation conditions, the exocyclic double bond (the isopropenyl group) may be hydrogenated first.

Wait, another thought: the original limonene is (R)-(+)-limonene. Let's analyze its structure in terms of known compounds. Limonene's structure is 1-methyl-4-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene. So there are two double bonds: one in the cyclohexene ring (C1-C2 double bond) and another in the substituent (C1 of the substituent being a double bond to C2). Therefore, the molecule has two double bonds. But according to the formula C10H16: you have two double bonds and one ring.

Wait, wait: substituting cyclohexene with a group that has another double bond. If cyclohexene ring itself has a double bond (ring is 6-membered with one double bond) and the substituent (at C4) is a propenyl group (CH2-CH2-CH2? No, in limonene, the substituent is isopropenyl: CH2-C(CH2)2. Wait, the substituent attached to the cyclohexene ring at C4 is 3-methyl-1-propenyl group. Thus, the substituent has its own double bond, making the total double bonds two. Hence, the structure of limonene has two double bonds: cyclohexene ring and a substituent double bond.

So when hydrogenating with Pd/C and H2, if selectivity is such that the exocyclic double bond (the substituent's) gets hydrogenated first because it's less substituted (terminal), while the endocyclic (ring) double bond is more substituted and perhaps dearmerized then. 

Alternatively, Pd/C is a catalyst for hydrogenation; so perhaps addition occurs first to the more accessible double bond.

But for our purposes: regardless of the reason, only one equivalent of H2 is added. Since limonene has two double bonds, and adding one equivalent would hydrogenate one double bond. So product 1 is monocyclic with one double bond remaining. Then, when it's treated with mCPBA, the remaining double bond is epoxidized, forming Product 2.

Then, the third step is treating Product 2 (the epoxide) with sodium methoxide, which is a base, probably leading to an epoxide ring-opening reaction. Sodium methoxide would deprotonate a proton, leading a nucleophilic attack. The epoxide would open under basic conditions to form an alcohol.

Lastly, treating Product 3 with propanoic acid, DCC (dicyclohexylcarbodiimide), and catalytic DMAP (which is an acyl transfer catalyst) would lead to esterification. Since DCC is a coupling agent for activating carboxylic acids to form active esters, allowing reaction with alcohols to form esters. Therefore, if Product 3 has an alcohol group, Product 4 will have a propionate ester.

Now, let me synthesize all steps:

1. Start with (R)-limonene: structure with two double bonds (cycle and substituent)

Hydrogenation in the first step (1 eq. H2) would hydrogenate one of them. Assuming the substituent double bond is more reactive, that would be hydrogenated. So from limonene (with cyclohexene and isopropenyl group) to structure where the substituent becomes isopropyl, and cyclohexene double bond remains. So Product 1: 1-methyl-4-(isopropyl)cyclohexene? Or maybe switch.

Wait, super difficult. Need to visualize (R)-limonene. Let me search alternative approach. Suppose limonene position of rings and substituents. (R)-Limonene structure is: a cyclohexene with a substituted bridge leading to a bicycle. For instance, bicyclo[4.1.0]hept-2-ene derivative. Alternatively, looking up online structure that limonene is a cyclic monoterpene with the structure 1-methyl-4-prop-1-en-2-ylcyclohex-1-ene. The substituent at position 4 has another double bond (prop-1-en-2-yl: so CH2-C(=CH2)-?), actually, it's isopropenyl group (CH2C(CH2)=CH2?), no. 

Wait, the substituent in limonene is the isopropenyl group: -CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Or CH2-CH(CH2)2, I'm getting confused. Let me correct.

Correct structure of limonene is 1-methyl-4-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene. So the substitutent is a propene group (three carbons overall) attached via the central carbon (hence 'prop-1-en-2-yl'), forming the substituent. So:

The ring is cyclohexene (double bond between C1 and C2). At C1, a methyl group, and at C4, a substituent which is -CH(CH2)hmmm. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl substituent is CH2=CH(CH2–) ?

Wait, substitution terms: the group is propene, which is CH2=CHCH2-, but since it's "prop-1-en-2-yl", so the substituent is attached at carbon 2 of the propene chain, resulting in a structure like CH2=C(CH3)-, which would be the 2-propenyl group. Hmm, yes. So prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=C(CH2)-? No. Wait, the substituent prop-1-en-2-yl group would be:

Positions: 1----2----3

      double bond at 1-2,

so  the structure is CH2=C(H)CH2-, but substituent is attached at position 2. So if the group (prop-1-en-2-yl) is attached via carbon 2, then carbon 2 could have substituents. 

Wait, chemical nomenclature is exact. A prop-1-en-2-yl group is:

       CH2-

       C=CH2

Where the central carbon (C2) is connected to the cyclohexene ring. So the group is CH2-C(=CH2)-. But that equals a vinyl group with a methyl substitution? So substituent is methyl substituted vinyl:

Prop-1-en-2-yl: CH2=C(CH2-)-. Hmm.

Therefore, limonene's structure being:

cyclohexene ring (C1-C2 double bond) with methyl on C1 and substituent on C4 as prop-1-en-2-yl (so C4 has a substituent group with structure CH2-C(=CH2)-). 

Now, hydrogenating where? If we hydrogenate one double bond, the reaction might choose either the cyclohexene ring or the exocyclic (prop-1-en-2-yl) group. The reaction conditions matter. Pd/C is typically for catalytic hydrogenation. 

Terminal alkenes are usually more reactive. The exocyclic double bond (prop-1-en-2-yl group) is probably a terminal double bond versus the cyclohexene, which is internal. Hence, under hydrogenation, the more reactive exocyclic double bond would be hydrogenated first. When 1 equivalent of H2 is added, it's the exocyclic propene group. Thus product 1 would be cyclohexene ring remaining, but substituent is now isopropyl.

So product 1 would be 1-methyl-4-isopropylcyclohex-1-ene? No, wait: if hydro gen oxides the exocyclic alkene, thus converting the prop-1-en-2-yl group (CH2=C(CH3)- ) into propane-2-yl group (CH(CH3)2- )? I think stepping through:

Original substituent: CH2-CH(CH2)-? No, after hydrogenation of a prop-1-en-2-yl group (CH2=C(CH3)- ). Adding H2 via Pd/C would addition. Syn-addition: geminal hydrogen would be added perhaps. So the substituent would become -CH2CH(CH3). So, isopropyl group: - CH(CH2CH3)? 

Wait, if the original substituent is -CH2-C(CH3)= "ummies --- need to re.


Wait, the substituent in limonene's structure:

If prop-1-en-2-yl is the group, then it’s CH2=C(CH3)-. So when that double bond is hydrogenated, H comes in - CH2-CH(CH3) -, from CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? Wait, original prop-1-en-2-yl (the substituent):

Carbon chain: at C4 of the cyclohexene, attached to C2 of the propene. Structure should be:

...at C4 of the cyclohexene: a CH2-C(double bond)=CH2. Hence, Prop-1-en-2-yl group: the substituent is a vinil group attached to carbon 4.

So:
 
Cyclohexene (C1=C2) ring with a methyl at C1 and a substituent at C4 that is CH2-C( CH2)=CH2. Hence, double bond between C2 and C3 of the substituent.

Wait, squeezing deeper. Let me write it.

Limonene structure:

Cyclohexene ring: positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. With double bond between 1 and 2.

At C1: methyl group (CH3).

At C4: substituent such that substituent is Prop-1-en-2-yl.

If "Prop-1-en-2-yl" refers to the substituent starting with prop-1-ene: CH2=CH-CH2- but since it's at the 2-position: Alternate notation: In this case, the substituent is attached to C2 of the propene.

Wait, maybe better to refer to the substituent as:

Prop-1-en-2-yl group: positions are:

1       2         3 

CH2- C=CH2

But with substituent attached to C2 (which is double bonded to C1). Thus the substituent is >C=CH2 (C2 is connected to three groups: a =CH2 and two others). Wait, perhaps cheating. Prop-1-en-2-yl: if numbered 1, 2, 3 (like in propene), the double bond is 1-2. The substituent is on carbon 2, so it's:

carbon 1 (CH2-), carbon 2 (with substituent and double bond), carbon 3 (CH2-).

But knowing IUPAC nomenclature, "prop-1-en-2-yl" would have the double bond between C1 and C2, and the point of attachment at carbon 2.

Thus, the chemical structure is:

     CH2=C-CH2-
          |
         (attachment point here is on C2)

Which is more like CH2-C(=CH2)-. But as a substituent, that's a cyclopropane situation? Let's directly write it:

The substituent at C4 of the cyclohexene is -(CH2)–C(=CH2). Thus, that would make the substituent an isopropenyl group: -C(CH2)=CH2.

Now, hydrogenating that substituent's double bond (which was part of the isopropenyl group) would create cyclopropane's substituent part into a saturated group. If undergoing hydrogenation:

CH2-C( = CH2 ) → CH2-CH(CH2)-

Wait, no, hydrogenation on HM vehicle:

The substituent is isopropenyl:

- C(=CH2) - CH2? Wait, not sure. Alternatively, during hydrogenation of the substituent's double bond, from prop-1-en-2-yl to isopropyl.

So the substituent which was previously CH2-C(CH3)=CH2 (not exact but something like this likely) hydrogenated to CH2-CH(CH2)CH3? Like adding two Hs across =CH2.

Wait, it's maybe better to accept that after hydrogenation of the exocyclic double bond ( substituent), product 1 would have a saturated isopropyl substituent and retain the cyclohexene ring. So Product 1 is now 1-methyl-4-isopropylcyclohexene? No, the original substituent becomes isopropyl.

But regardless, After hyrogenating the exocyclic ( substituent) double bond, the remaining is the cyclohexene double bond. Hence, Product 1 should be 1-methyl-4-isopropylcyclohexene (actually, orthomer thancaplained compounds.

Wait, better yet, after hydrogenation of the exocyclic group limonene's double bond (in the isopropenyl substituent), product 1 becomes 1-methyl-4-isopropylcyclohexene. Does that seem about right?

Yes. Now, next step:

Product 1 is treated with mCPBA (3-chloroperbenzoic acid). mCPBA is a peracid that epoxidizes double bonds. Therefore, the remaining cyclohexene double bond (in product 1) would undergo epoxidation. So Product 2 is the epoxide derivative of 1-methyl-4-isopropylcyclohexene. The epoxide would form at the former cyclohexene double bond (between C1 and C2), so produce 1,2-epoxide of 1-methyl-4-isopropylcyclohexane.

Now, this is the epoxide, Product 2. Then, when it's treated with sodium methoxide (a strong base), this would induce epoxide ring-opening via nucleophilic attack. In basic conditions, the nucleophile (MeO-) would deprotonate to form an alkoxide, which attacks the less substituted side of the epoxide. The epoxide's stereochemistry and the positions of substituents will dictate where the attack occurs.

Given that the cyclohexane (now epoxide) is 1-methyl-4-isopropyl, the ring-opening would give an alcohol. Let's imagine the cyclohexene-derived epoxide being cis or trans. Epoxidation could form either a cis or trans based on the starting alkene’s configuration.

But for cyclohexene, epoxidation would form an epoxide with a trans configuration between the oxygen atoms? Because epoxidation forms the epoxide on the same face (mCPBA acts as an electrophilic agent, adding across the face where the peracid approaches). For a cyclohexene in a chair-like conformation, trans-diepoxide but for cyclohexene it would give an cis epoxide. Wait, maybe not. Let me think: the endo epoxidation procedure might induce specific orientations.

However, regardless, when the epoxide opens under basic conditions (sodium methoxide), the nucleophile (methoxide) would deprotonate to give an alkoxide which then attacks the less hindered carbon. The epoxide's Semler-Taylor-House? process: in base, the nucleophile (methanol's conjugate base?) would attack the less hindered epoxide carbon. Alternatively, in 1,2-epoxy-1-methyl-4-isopropylcyclohexane, which carbons would they attack?  

The epoxide spans C1 and C2. At C1, there’s a methyl group, and at C4, an isopropyl. The cyclohexane islikely in a chair conformation, and the epoxide is trans, oxygen atoms on adjacent carbons on opposite faces. Wait, this is getting complicated. Perhaps regardless of stereochemistry, the base would lead to an attack on the less substituted epoxide carbon. In this case, since C1 has a methyl group, and C2 presumably has a hydrogen and maybe another substituent, sn2 attack occurs. Could the major product here lead to the formation of a trans-diol?

Wait, under basic conditions, epoxide ring-opening proceeds via a nucleophilic attack. The alkoxide (generated from MeO-) attacks the less hindered epoxide carbon. In 1-methyl-4-isopropylcyclohexane oxide: the epoxide oxygen is between C1 and C2 in a cyclohexane ring. At C1: methyl group; on C2: likely either axial or equatorial depending on orientation.

Therefore, the attack occurs at C2 (since C1 is substituted with a methyl group, making it more hindered), leading to the nucleophile attacking C2. The opening of the epoxide would result in the formation of a trans-diol (alcohols on adjacent carbons with trans stereochemistry). However, in a ring system like cyclohexane, this might be an intramolecular twist.

Alternatively, more accurately, epoxide ring opening with a strong base in a cyclic system forms a trans-diaxial diol. In Boat-like transition states, but underlying chair conformations could allow for axial attack.

Assuming the oxygen of the epoxide is axial and equatorial positions. If the cyclohexane ring is in a chair conformation with substituents to consider, leading to the epoxide positioned such that when it opens, the two OH groups (given that in a trans opening) would arrange in the diequatorial or axial positions. However, sodium methoxide's conditions ensure ring-opening another Lucas.

Wait, possibly another pathway: epoxide ring opening forms regardless alcohol (trans-diol), but due to the structure of the cyclohexane ring. So in this scenario, sodium methoxide (which is MeONa) extracts a proton immediately adjacent to the epoxide (possibly via basic OMe-), generating an alkoxide that attacks the neighboring carbon.

For example, imagine the epoxide between C1 and C2. The Base deprotonates at C3 (if adjacent), but traditionally, in epoxide ring opening, the attack at one of the epoxide's carbons. Alternatively, when treated with a base like OH- in SN2 fashion, the nucleophile removes a proton adjacent to the epoxide leading to an attack. But is the base likely to attack a hydrogen alpha to the epoxide?

No, in the case of base-catalyzed epoxide ring opening, providing S_N2-like mechanism, the nucleophile (in this case, the methoxide?) would attacks the less hindered epoxide carbon. The substituents (like methyl and isopropyl) would direct the attack towards a specific carbon (presumably the most available), leading to the major product 3.

Alternatively, considering the chair cyclohexane with epoxide and substituents, whichever side is more accessible, product would form. This is difficult to judge without the exact structure. So perhaps after the epoxide opening, product 3 is trans-1,2-cyclohexane diol (with methyl and isopropyl substituents). The diol would make two alcohol groups on the cyclohexane ring.

Now, in step four: product 3 is treated with propanoic acid, DCC, and DMAP. These conditions are classic for Steglich酯化, converting an alcohol to an ester. DCC is a carbodiimide used as a carbodiimide coupling reagent. The conditions reacting propanoic acid (carboxylic acid) with an alcohol (from product 3) to form an ester. Since product 3 is diol (two alcohols), this conditions would esterify each alcohol independently, but since two alcohols are present, why wouldn’t it form a diester? However, if regioselective (if one alcohol is more reactive than the other), product 4 is a mono-ester or possibly a mixture of diesters and monomers. However, the problem states that product 4 is a mixture of isomers and we need to provide a valid structure (without stereomerism). However, creationfan's question.

But let's recount. Product 3 is 1,2 diol (e.g., trans-1,2 diol) in a cyclohexane ring with methyl and isopropyl substituents. Now, treatment with propanoic acid and DCC/DMAP may lead to forming an ester at either of the two hydroxyl groups. Depending on which hydroxyl is more reactive, possibly the less hindered one would form the ester.

However, cyclohexane diols (trans or cis) can have axial or equatorial hydroxyl groups. If one hydroxyl is axial and the other equatorial, perhaps the equatorial is more reactive because it's more accessible. Or in case of vicinal diols (adjacent), such as trans-1,2-diol, one of them tends to be in more hindered position.

But again, need to infer. If product 3 is a trans-1,2-diol, then on cyclohexane, the two hydroxyls are adjacent and trans to each other. However, in a chair conformation, those hydroxyl groups could be diequatorial or axial.

Given that trans-1,2-diol in a chair would require one axial and one equatorial place. Impossible. Hence(Wait, 1,2-diol trans:

If carbon 1 has an axial OH, carbon 2 would would need to have equatorial OH to be trans. Is that possible? When neighboring atoms. Trans-diol in a 1,2 cyclohexane structure would a XS to have neighboring O's with one axial and another equatorial. 

Alternatively, sticking with a boat conformation.

Adios, Lo siento.

Anyway, without clear structural insight, considering generality, Product 4 will have one or two esters. But since the question specifies Product 4 is a mixture of isomers (stereo?), so Product 4 likely has a esterification at one OH group, leaving the other one. Hence, two possible mono-esters which are isomers, geometric or positional, depending on which OH group is esterified.

Alternatively,that the original diol had two diastereomeric pairs after開hoc reaction, but DCC-mediated esterification is typically regioselective? Without detailed odds, I need to ask: what's most plausible?

Alternatively, maybe the initial is a bridged structure. If after all the reactions, the molecule resembles a bridged bicyclic)) with ester groups. Wait, but would limonene become bridged after these steps?

Wait, let's think through:

Limonene structure: ...
Alternatively, retracing steps with presumed Product 4: 

1. (R)-limonene (structure: cyclic hydrocarbon with substituents) 


Hydrogenated: product 1 has one less double bond. mCPBA oxidizes remaining double bond to epoxide.


Epoxide thenopens to diol with sodium methoxide. Diol reacted with propionic acid and esterified. So product 4 is a diol (cis or trans) with ester groups. 

Wait, if the starting material led to two equivalent alcohol groups, they might form a mixture of twoteered esters. Buteach ester's position would be where oneohmnol from alcohol obtained.

However, perhaps we can sketch the structures:

If Product 3 is trans-1,2-diolsicker's letter, then Product4 is the mono-profane人steroid of that diol. Assuming stereoisomers (which one is esterified), implying two possible products. But prompt just says product4 exists as mixture, and correct answer is one of them. Hence, the structure would have oneod, intake propionayloxi group.

 After considering all the steps and reactions, product 4 is the methyl isopropyl cyclohexane diol esterified with propionic acid. The major isomer would depend on which hydroxyl group is more reactive, usually the less hindered one. Possible candidates are the ester formed at C1 or C2, making them isomers. Thus, Product 4 has either the C1 or C2 hydroxyl group esterified with propanoic acid.
