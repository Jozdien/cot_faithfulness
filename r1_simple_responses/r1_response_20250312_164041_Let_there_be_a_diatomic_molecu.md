# R1 response

To determine the momentum of a photon required for a diatomic molecule (X and Y) to transition from its fundamental state to the next lowest energy state, we consider both vibrational and rotational energy transitions. 

**Key Parameters:**
- Reduced mass, \( \mu = \frac{M_X M_Y}{M_X + M_Y} \)
- Moment of inertia, \( I = \mu R^2 \)
- Rotational energy difference, \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{I} \)
- Photon momentum, \( p = \Delta E / c \)

**Calculations:**
1. **Reduced Mass:**
   \[
   \mu = \frac{20 \times 2}{20 + 2} \text{ amu} = \frac{40}{22} \text{ amu} \approx 1.818 \text{ amu}
   \]
   Converting to kilograms:
   \[
   \mu \approx 3.02 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}
   \]

2. **Moment of Inertia:**
   \[
   I = \mu R^2 = (3.02 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}) (2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m})^2 = 1.208 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2
   \]

3. **Rotational Energy Difference:**
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{I} = \frac{(1.05457 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s})^2}{1.208 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2} \approx 9.2 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
   \]

4. **Photon Momentum:**
   \[
   p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} = \frac{9.2 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}}{3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}} \approx 3.1 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg·m/s}
   \]

**Conclusion:**
The absorbed photon must have a momentum of approximately \(\boxed{3.1 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg·m/s}}\) to transition to the next lowest rotational energy state.

# R1 reasoning

Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, we have a diatomic molecule made up of atoms X and Y, with masses 20 amu and 2 amu respectively. The bond length is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency of vibration is 4e14 rad/s. The question is asking, if the molecule is in its fundamental (ground) state, what momentum should an absorbed photon have to make the molecule transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy. 

Hmm. I remember that in the rotation-vibration model (non-rigid rotor model), the energy levels are determined by both vibrational and rotational contributions. So the total energy is a combination of vibrational energy and rotational energy. The fundamental state would be the lowest vibrational state (n=0) and the lowest rotational state (l=0, maybe?), but I need to recall the exact energy level formulas.

Let me break it down. For vibrational energy, the quantum harmonic oscillator model is used. The energy levels are given by E_vib = (n + 1/2)ħω, where n is the vibrational quantum number (n=0,1,2,...). So the ground state is n=0, and the first excited state would be n=1. However, transitions usually follow selection rules. For vibrational transitions, I think the selection rule is Δn = ±1 for the harmonic oscillator. But maybe in this problem, the transition is from n=0 to n=1, which would require a photon with energy equal to the difference between these two levels.

But wait, the problem says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy". That might mean going from the ground state (n=0, l=0) to either a higher vibrational state, rotational state, or a combination. However, in the rotation-vibration model, the energy also has rotational contributions. The rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = (ħ²/(2I)) * l(l+1), where I is the moment of inertia and l is the rotational quantum number. But I also remember that in the non-rigid rotor model, there's a coupling between vibration and rotation, so the rotational constant might depend on the vibrational state. But perhaps, for the lowest possible energy transition, it's just either a rotational or vibrational transition.

So, which transition requires less energy: going from n=0 to n=1 (vibrational) or from l=0 to l=1 (rotational)? I think vibrational transitions require more energy because the energy spacing is larger. Let me calculate both to compare.

First, compute the vibrational energy difference. ΔE_vib = E_vib(n=1) - E_vib(n=0) = ħω. Since ω is given as 4e14 rad/s. So ΔE_vib = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) * 4e14 s^-1 ≈ 4.218e-20 J. 

Now, rotational energy transition. For rotational, we need to compute the energy difference between l=0 and l=1. The rotational energy is E_rot(l) = (ħ² / (2I)) * l(l+1). So going from l=0 to l=1, ΔE_rot = E_rot(1) - E_rot(0) = (ħ² / (2I))*(1*2 - 0) = ħ² / I.

But we need to compute I, the moment of inertia. The moment of inertia for a diatomic molecule is I = μR², where μ is the reduced mass. 

Let's calculate μ first. μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My). Mx is 20 amu and My is 2 amu. Convert amu to kg: 1 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg. So Mx = 20*1.6605e-27 = 3.321e-26 kg. My = 2*1.6605e-27 = 3.321e-27 kg. Then μ = (3.321e-26 * 3.321e-27) / (3.321e-26 + 3.321e-27) = Let's compute denominator: 3.321e-26 + 3.321e-27 = 3.321e-26 + 0.3321e-26 = 3.6531e-26 kg. Then μ = (3.321e-26 * 3.321e-27) / 3.6531e-26.

Multiplying numerator: 3.321e-26 * 3.321e-27 = (3.321)^2 * 1e-53 ≈ 11.031 * 1e-53 = 1.1031e-52. Then μ ≈ 1.1031e-52 / 3.6531e-26 ≈ 3.02e-27 kg. So μ is approximately 3.02e-27 kg.

Now, the bond length R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. Hence, I = μR² = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.02e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg·m².

Then ΔE_rot = ħ² / I. Since ħ ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s. So ħ² = (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J²·s². Then ΔE_rot = 1.112e-68 / 1.208e-46 ≈ 9.2e-23 J. Compare this to the vibrational energy difference, which was ~4.218e-20 J. So the rotational transition requires much less energy than the vibrational. Therefore, the next state with the lowest possible energy might be the first rotational excited state while remaining in the same vibrational state. But wait, the problem says the molecule is in its fundamental state. "Fundamental state" usually refers to the ground vibrational state, but I think rotational states can still be excited. So maybe the next state with the lowest energy would be the first rotational state, l=1, in the same vibrational state n=0.

But wait, perhaps the selection rules for rotational transitions require Δl = ±1, so from l=0 you can go to l=1. However, usually in rotational spectroscopy, the selection rules require a change in dipole moment, and for a diatomic molecule like this (heteronuclear, since X and Y are different) the rotational transitions are allowed with Δl = ±1. So, to go from l=0 to l=1, the photon must have energy ΔE_rot ≈ 9.2e-23 J. Then the momentum of the photon would be p = E/c, where c is the speed of light.

Alternatively, if instead the lowest possible energy transition is vibrational, which is ΔE_vib ≈ 4.218e-20 J, then p = ΔE_vib / c. Since 4.218e-20 / 3e8 ≈ 1.4e-28 kg·m/s. But rotational would be 9.2e-23 /3e8 ≈ 3.07e-31 kg·m/s. Therefore, since 3.07e-31 is much smaller than 1.4e-28, the rotational transition requires a photon with much smaller momentum. Therefore, the question is whether the "next state with the lowest possible energy" is the lowest rotational state above the ground state or the next vibrational state.

But I need to make sure which transitions are allowed. For vibrational transitions, Δn = ±1, but does that hold here? And if the molecule changes vibrational state, can it also change rotational state? Wait, in reality, vibrational transitions often have rotational transitions accompanied because the rotational constant can change with vibrational state, but in the problem statement, maybe the question is considering only transitions changing either vibrational or rotational, not both. Wait, the problem says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy". So to get the lowest possible energy above the ground state, which is smaller between rotational and vibrational?

But from the calculations, ΔE_rot ≈ 9.2e-23 J and ΔE_vib ≈ 4.2e-20 J. So the rotational transition is lower in energy, meaning a photon with less energy (and hence less momentum) would cause a transition to a rotational state. However, in the rotational-vibrational model, transitions can involve both changes in n and l. Wait, but in infrared spectroscopy, transitions are usually vibrational with Δn=±1 and Δl=±1. Because the photon has both the energy for the vibrational transition and the angular momentum for the rotational transition. But infrared photons usually have energy corresponding to vibrational transitions, and during those, rotational transitions also happen. But for microwave photons, they have energy corresponding to rotational transitions, so those would just change l by ±1. But the question here is a bit more ambiguous.

But according to the problem statement, it's asking for the momentum of the photon absorbed to go to the "next state with the lowest possible energy". So if the molecule is in its fundamental state, which is n=0, l=0, then the next lowest energy states would be either n=1, l=0 or n=0, l=1. Since the energy of n=1, l=0 would be E = (1 + 1/2)ħω + rotational energy (which is (ħ²/(2I)) * 0*(0+1) )= 1.5ħω + 0. So that energy is higher than the ground state's (0.5ħω). So, the difference would be 1.5ħω - 0.5ħω = ħω (vibrational transition). Similarly, the rotational transition would be E_rot from l=0 to l=1, which is from 0 to (ħ²/(2I)) * 2.

Therefore, the energy difference for the pure vibrational transition is larger (ħω) and the pure rotational is (ħ²/I).

Comparing the two:

Our calculated values are ΔE_vib ≈ 4.218e-20 J and ΔE_rot ≈9.2e-23 J, so indeed the rotational transition is lower in energy. Therefore, switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy would require a photon with energy ΔE_rot, so p = ΔE_rot / c. Therefore, calculate that.

Wait, but is the transition allowed? For a rotational transition to occur, the molecule must have a permanent dipole moment, which heteronuclear diatomic molecules do have. So since X and Y are different (different masses, so likely different atoms), it is a heteronuclear diatomic, thus dipole allowed. The selection rule is Δl = ±1. Therefore, going from l=0 to l=1 is allowed. So the photon's angular momentum is 1 (since photon is spin 1), and can cause Δl = ±1. Therefore, yes, it's allowed.

Therefore, the next state with the lowest possible energy is l=1, n=0. Therefore, the energy required is ΔE_rot = ħ² / I.

But let's make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating μ and I. Let me recalculate:

Given Mx =20 amu, My=2 amu. The reduced mass μ= (20*2)/(20+2) amu = (40)/(22) amu ≈1.818 amu. 1.818 amu times 1.6605e-27 kg/amu = 1.818 *1.6605e-27 ≈ 3.019e-27 kg, which matches the previous calculation. So μ≈3.02e-27 kg.

Bond length R=2 angstroms=2e-10 m. So I=μR²≈3.02e-27 kg*(2e-10 m)^2=3.02e-27 *4e-20=1.208e-46 kg·m². Correct.

Then E_rot(1)= (ħ²/(2I)) *1*(1+1)= (ħ² / 2I)*2= ħ² / I. So ΔE_rot= ħ² / I.

So ħ=1.0545718e-34 J·s. So ħ²≈1.112e-68 J²·s². Then ħ² / I ≈1.112e-68 /1.208e-46 ≈9.2e-23 J. Yes.

Speed of light c≈3e8 m/s. Therefore, momentum p= ΔE /c≈9.2e-23 J /3e8 m/s≈3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

But wait, the question says "momentum should an absorbed photon have". Photon momentum is p=E/c, so that's correct.

But could the momentum also be related to the angular momentum change? Wait, photon has spin 1, so when it's absorbed, it can change the angular momentum by ±1, which fits with Δl=±1. So the angular momentum part is fine. Therefore, the photon's linear momentum is p=E/c.

Therefore, p ≈3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

But let me check calculations again.

μ= (20*2)/(20+2)=40/22=1.818... amu. So 1.818*1.6605e-27= 3.019e-27 kg.

I= μR²=3.019e-27*(2e-10)^2=3.019e-27*4e-20=1.2076e-46 kg·m².

ΔE_rot=ħ²/I=(1.05457e-34)^2 /1.2076e-46≈(1.112e-68)/1.2076e-46≈9.21e-23 J.

p=9.21e-23 /3e8=3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

So that seems right. For the rotational transition.

The alternative vibrational transition would have p=4.218e-20 /3e8≈1.406e-28 kg·m/s. But that requires a higher momentum. Since the problem asks for the transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy, and rotational transition requires less energy (lower photon momentum), so that's the answer.

But wait, I should check the vibration-rotation coupling. In reality, rotational constants depend on vibrational state due to the bond length changing during vibration. However, the problem mentions it's modeled as a non-rigid rotor. The non-rigid rotor model usually considers that the bond is not perfectly rigid, leading to centrifugal distortion. But perhaps the problem expects us to use the rigid rotor model for rotational energy and harmonic oscillator for vibration. Since non-rigid rotor model's energy expression would include a centrifugal distortion term, but without given any such constant, maybe the problem just combines rigid rotor and harmonic oscillator. 

Alternatively, maybe the next state with the lowest possible energy is a combination of n=1 and l=1. Wait, but the coupling between rotation and vibration is considered in the non-rigid rotor model. However, the question doesn't specify whether we are to assume transitions that change both n and l. But since the model is called the "rotation-vibration model", probably this coupling is not considered here, and we can assume that vibrational and rotational transitions are independent. 

But the selection rules for vibrational transitions usually allow Δl = ±1. So when a vibrational transition occurs (Δn=±1), simultaneously the rotational state can change by Δl=±1. So in infrared spectroscopy, vibrational transitions are accompanied by rotational transitions, resulting in P and R branches (Δl=-1 and +1). But in this problem, unless specified, perhaps the minimal energy transition is considered: which would be purely rotational, since the energy difference is smaller.

But actually, if a photon has enough energy to cause a vibrational transition, which includes a larger energy, then that would be jumping to a higher energy state. But the problem asks for the "next state with the lowest possible energy", which would require the minimal ΔE. Since rotational energy difference is much lower, even though in reality such transitions are in the microwave region (rotational) vs infrared (vibrational). So I think the correct answer here is the rotational transition. 

Therefore, the momentum of the absorbed photon is approximately 3.07e-31 kg·m/s. However, I should check if the problem wants the answer in terms of ħk, which is the momentum of the photon. The photon momentum p is indeed ħk, and also E=pc for a photon, since E=hc/λ and p=h/λ, so E=pc. But here, using E=ħω for vibrational transitions would not hold, because vibrational energy is quantized in the molecule, but the photon's energy hν needs to match ΔE. However, for the rotational transition, photon's energy is ΔE_rot=ħ²/(2I) *l(l+1)|from 0 to1. Wait, no. For rotational transition from l to l+1, ΔE= (ħ²/(2I))[( (l+1)(l+2) - l(l+1) ) ]= (ħ²/(2I)) [2(l+1)].

For l=0, this becomes (ħ²/(2I))*2= ħ²/(I), which matches the previous calculation. 

But phonon's angular momentum is involved in rotational transitions, but since we are only asked for linear momentum p of the photon, which is p=E/c. Therefore, my calculation holds.

Hence, the answer is p= ħ²/(I c). Let me compute that.

Wait, actually, let me see:

E_phot = ħ²/(2I)*( l'(l' +1) - l(l+1) )

Here, the ground state is l=0, so E_phot= ħ²/(2I)*( 1*2 -0 )= ħ²/(I). Therefore, p= E/c= ħ²/(I c).

But as calculated:

I=1.2076e-46 kg·m². ħ=1.05457e-34 J·s.

So plug in:

p= (1.05457e-34)^2 / (1.2076e-46 *3e8)

Compute numerator: approx 1.112e-68

Denominator:1.2076e-46*3e8=3.6228e-38

Thus p=1.112e-68 / 3.6228e-38 ≈ 3.07e-31 kg·m/s. So same result.

So, 3.07e-31 kg·m/s is the photon momentum.

But let's express that using exact numbers, perhaps in terms of given variables.

Alternatively, need to give in terms of the given parameters (Mx, My, R, w). So revisiting the variables:

The user gave Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu, R=2 angstroms, w=4e14 rad/s.

But in the momentum expression: p= ħ²/(I c )

We know that I=μR², and μ= (Mx My)/(Mx + My). Therefore,

p= ħ² / (μ R² c ).

Alternatively, written in terms of variables:

p= ħ² / [ (Mx My/(Mx + My)) R² c ].

But the question states to calculate the value given those specific values, so we need to compute it numerically.

Another point: units.

We have masses in amu, R in angstroms, and angular frequency in rad/s. Need to make sure that our calculation uses SI units.

What's 1 amu? As in initial calculations, we use 1 amu=1.6605e-27 kg. Correct.

Angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R=2e-10 m. And all SI units for the formula.

Therefore, the momentum is indeed numerical: same as before, 3.07e-31 kg·m/s. Now, can this be expressed in terms of some formula (from variables)?

Alternatively, if possible, the answer can be given symbolically.

But since the question asks for the answer given the parameters, it's best to provide the numerical value.

But perhaps the problem expects the vibrational transition. Let me think again. The problem says "the molecule is in its fundamental state". In some contexts, the fundamental state may include both vibrational and rotational ground states. If the next lowest energy state is vibrational n=1 with rotational l=0, which is ΔE= ħω. If that is the case, then the momentum would be higher. So it depends on whether the problem considers that "fundamental state" allows for rotational transitions. Maybe I need to consider that for vibrational transitions, even within a vibrational state, there are rotational levels, and the overall ground state is n=0, l=0. Now, is the next lowest energy state in the same vibrational level (n=0, l=1) or in n=1, l=0? 

In terms of energy, which one is lower? It depends on which energy difference is smaller.

As calculated:

ΔE_rot ≈9.2e-23 J.

ΔE_vib≈4.2e-20 J.

So ΔE_rot << ΔE_vib, so the next lowest energy state is n=0, l=1. Hence, that transition requires a photon with p ≈3e-31 kg·m/s.

But in the rotation-vibration model, sometimes when you have a vibrational transition, the rotational state can also change. And that complicates the energy levels. But again, the question is phrased as switching to the "next state with the lowest possible energy", which would be the closest higher energy state. So which direction leads to the minimal ΔE.

But given the difference in energy (rotational is smaller), the correct answer is to use the rotational transition.

Hence, concluding that the momentum of the photon is approximately 3.07e-31 kg·m/s. Let me round based on significant figures. Given the values:

Masses given as 20 amu and 2 amu (two significant figures each). Bond length 2 angstroms (one significant figure). Angular frequency 4e14 rad/s (one significant figure). However, these inputs imply that the answer should also have one or two significant figures.

But let's see:

From Mx: 20 (2 sig figs), My:2 (1 sig fig), R:2 (1), w:4 (1)

The reduced mass μ uses Mx and My. Let's see how that affects μ:

μ = (20*2)/(20+2)=40/22≈1.818... but the numerator Mx*My is 20*2=40 (1 sig fig, since My is 1 s.f. and Mx is ambiguous as 20 (could be 1 or 2 s.f.)). Wait, problem says Mx is 20 amu. If written as 20, depending on context, it's ambiguous, but in scientific notation, it's often assumed to be the number of sig figs. Since the user used 20 amu (could be one or two sig figs, but unless a decimal is given, preferably, the original problem specifies as e.g., 2.0e1 amu for two sig figs). Since it's stated as "20 amu" similar to "2 amu", which can be 1 or 2 sig figs, but 2 amu is 1 sig fig, 20 amu could be considered two (if written as two.zero), but given no decimal, it's safer to assume one. Wait, actually, 20 can be considered 1 or 2 sig figs. Depending on notation, for example, 20. would be two, but 20 is one. Hmm. Maybe in this case, the user didn't give precision, so we have to accept that maybe it's exact, but in the absence of more information, it's up to interpretation. But in many problem statements, numbers like 20, 2 etc are given as exact.

However, regardless, perhaps answers are supposed to be calculated with the given numbers with their sig figs.

But assuming that, say, some of the quantities have one sig fig (like R=2 angstroms which is one sig fig, ΔE would come out to maybe one sig fig), but in our previous calculation, all given quantities contributed, and R as 2 A (1 SF), omega as 4e14 (1 SF), masses each maybe as 1-2 SF. Therefore, I think perhaps the answer is expected with one significant figure. However, maybe the exact values are exact, but the computation is messy.

Alternatively, let's check the calculation once again, properly handling unit conversions:

Mx=20 amu. 1 amu =1.6605e-27 kg. So, precisely 20*1.6605e-27=3.321e-26 kg. But if, for example, 20 amu has 1 sig fig, that would be 3e-26 kg. Similarly, My=2 amu=3.321e-27 kg. If taken as one sig fig, that's 3e-27 kg. Then reduce mass μ=(3e-26 *3e-27)/(3e-26 +3e-27). Now how would that calculation go. μ=(9e-53)/ (3.3e-26). So 9e-53 / 3.3e-26≈2.7e-27 kg. Still same order of magnitude.

If R=2 A=2e-10 m. I= μR²=2.7e-27*(4e-20)=1.08e-46 kg m².

ΔE_rot= ħ²/(I) ≈ (1e-34)^2 /1e-46= 1e-68 /1e-46=1e-22 J. Which means p= ~3e-31 kg m/s. Order of magnitude is 1e-31.

Therefore, even with considering sig figs, the answer would be ~ 3e-31 kg·m/s. 

But in precise calculation, with 3.07e-31, and considering the problem may expect units of kg·m/s, then answer with significant figures would be 3e-31 kg·m/s. But since some inputs have two sig figs (e.g., Mx=20amu maybe), the answer could have two. Let me see. Mx=20 amu (20. amu would imply 2 sig figs, but "20 amu" can also be 2). Hmmm. If My is 2 amu, then with one sig fig, but Mx=20 amu, if 20 is two sig figs, then the reduced mass has two sig figs, if R is one, I matches up. So in summary:

you calculate μ = (20)*(2)/(20+2) = 40/22 ≈1.818... in amu. But in kg: 1.818 amu *1.6605e-27=3.02e-27 kg (three sig figs). Then with R=2 A (implied one sig fig), μR²= (3.02e-27 kg)*(2e-10 m)^2=3.02e-27 *4e-20=1.208e-46 kg m² (which I have three sig figs due to three from μ, but multiplied by 4e-20 (maybe 1 sig fig from R). If we stick with R as one sig fig, then the whole I would be one sig fig. So ħ is a constant, so we'll count ħ as constant provided with sufficient precision. Then energy would be one sig fig. So the calculation:

E_rot≈1e-68 /1e-46=1e-22, but with proper factors, as calculated 9.2e-23, but 3.07e-31 kg·m/s, depends.

So, perhaps the problem expects rounded answer to one sig fig, so p≈3e-31 kg·m/s.

Alternatively, follow the given variables. But Ok, perhaps also, the harmonic term's frequency ω is being given as 4*10^14 rad/s. But if we take everything, with ΔE_rot= hbar²/(I).

If compute kbarier.

But actually, another way to calculate the rotational constant B is B = ħ/(4πμR²), but actually the rotational energy is E_rot = B l(l+1). But depending on the unit system. Often, rotational constants are in cm^-1 and so on, but since we are using SI units here:

Rotational constant B= ħ²/(2I). Then the energy levels are E_rot= B l(l+1). the spacing between l and l+1 is E_rot(l+1)-E_rot(l)=B[ (l+1)(l+2) - l(l+1) ]= B[2(l+1)]. For l=0, that's 2B. So ΔE_rot=2B.

But B= (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.2076e-46 ) ≈ (1.112e-68)/(2.415e-46 )≈4.606e-23 J. Then Delta E_rot=2B≈9.21e-23 J, matches prior.

Therefore, the photon momentum p= Delta E /c≈9.21e-23/3e8≈3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Therefore, perhaps, even accounting for all significant figures in the given data. The values given were:

Mx = 20 amu (possibly 2 SF), My =2 amu (1 SF), R=2 angstroms (1 SF), ω=4*10^14 rad/s (1 SF). The least SF here is generally 1 SF, but Mx could be 2. Therefore potentially.

But since angular frequency is given with 1 SF, and actually the answer mainly depends on the given rotational constants which uses Mx, My, R.

But varying:

If we double-check the μ with not considering the original decimal points. For instance, masses and bond length are stated as exactly 20amu, 2 amu, 2 A.

But uncertainties can be neglected as it's a model.

Therefore, no need to use error propagation. So calculated value is 3.1e-31 kg·m/s. We can write it as 3.1e-31.

But check if a calculation mistake.

Let me parametrize everywhere.

The conclusion is correct, the process seems logical. Therefore, the most probable answer is photon momentum of 3.1e-31 kg·m/s.
