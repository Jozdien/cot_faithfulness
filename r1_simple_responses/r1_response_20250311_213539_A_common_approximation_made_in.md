# Original Question

A common approximation made in many-body nuclear calculations of some interaction (for example an electroweak interaction) is to suppose that nucleons in a nucleus behave in the same way as free nucleons. Which of the following four assumptions jointly imply this ""impulse"" approximation?

1. The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.
2. The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.
3. The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.
4. The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.

Okay, so I have this question about the impulse approximation in many-body nuclear calculations. The question asks which of the four given assumptions together imply the impulse approximation, where nucleons in a nucleus behave like free nucleons during an interaction. 

Let me start by recalling what the impulse approximation is. If I remember correctly, in nuclear physics, the impulse approximation assumes that when a particle (like an electron or neutrino) interacts with a nucleon inside a nucleus, the nucleon can be treated as if it's free. This simplifies the calculations because you don't have to consider all the complex interactions within the nucleus, just the interaction with a single, quasi-free nucleon. The key idea is that the effect of the nuclear medium on the nucleon during the interaction is negligible.

Now, the question lists four assumptions, and I need to figure out which ones are necessary for the impulse approximation. Let me go through each one by one.

Assumption 1: The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.

Hmm, if the interaction current (say, in an electroweak interaction) only affects individual nucleons and not the nucleus as a whole, this might mean that the process is happening at the nucleon level. That sounds important for the impulse approximation because if the interaction were collective (involving multiple nucleons or the nucleus in a coherent way), you couldn't treat them individually as free. So this seems like a necessary condition. 

Assumption 2: The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.

Transparency here might refer to the idea that the rest of the nucleus doesn't affect the interaction. Like, if the incoming particle interacts only with one nucleon and the others don't get in the way—physically, that could relate to the mean free path being long enough or the nucleus not absorbing or scattering the probe particle except for the one nucleon. If the nucleus isn't transparent, then there might be multiple interactions or screening effects, which would complicate things, requiring more than just a single nucleon treatment. So transparency points to Assumption 2 being necessary. 

Assumption 3: The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.

So the impulse approximation might require that the internal structure of the nucleon isn't altered by the nuclear environment. If the quarks were relativistic, maybe their dynamics would be influenced by the surrounding nuclear medium, complicating the interaction. However, non-relativistic quarks would mean that the nucleon's structure is similar to a free nucleon. Wait, but quarks inside nucleons are typically considered relativistic, right? If the approximation relies on the nucleon structure being the same as free, maybe they have to assume that the binding doesn't make the quarks relativistic if they aren't in the nucleus. But I'm not sure. This might not be a critical assumption for the impulse approximation. Or perhaps, if the interaction is such that the quarks' motion is not significantly affected (non-relativistic), maybe the nucleon's internal structure is roughly the same as free. But I'm more uncertain about this one. Need to keep this in mind.

Assumption 4: The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.

This seems crucial. The impulse approximation requires that during the interaction, the nucleon is effectively free, which would mean that the binding forces from the nucleus aren't acting on it during the interaction time. If the binding forces were significant, the nucleon's response would be different compared to a free one. So this assumption (4) directly states that the nucleon is treated as free from binding forces during the interaction. Therefore, this is essential.

So putting this together: For the impulse approximation, we need the interaction to target individual nucleons (1), the rest of the nucleus doesn't interfere (2), and the nucleon isn't being affected by binding during the interaction (4). Then, what about point (3)? The internal quark structure. If the quarks are non-relativistic, maybe the nucleon's structure is similar to a free one, but typically, in reality, quarks are relativistic. So perhaps this assumption (3) isn't necessary, or maybe even if the quarks are relativistic, as long as their state isn't modified by the nuclear environment, the approximation holds. So maybe (3) is not required. 

Alternatively, maybe someone might think assumption 3 is necessary because if the quarks were moving relativistically inside the nucleon, the interaction might be different, but that's more relevant to the structure of the nucleon itself, not necessarily the approximation here. Since the impulse approximation is more about the nuclear medium's effect rather than the internal nucleon structure assuming the nucleon behaves as in free space. Therefore, if the quark structure is non-relativistic, perhaps the internal dynamics are the same as free, but if quarks stay the same as in free nucleons even if they are relativistic, then assumption 3 might not be needed. Therefore, maybe assumption 3 is a red herring, and the key points are 1, 2, and 4. But then the question says "jointly imply"—so which combination is required?

Wait, the options are four assumptions, and the question says which are the assumptions that "jointly imply"—so likely 1,2,4. Maybe translating that, but let me check again.

In textbooks: The impulse approximation, also known as the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation (PWIA), is often used in scattering calculations. The basic idea is that the incoming particle interacts with a single nucleon, treating the nucleon as free and ignoring initial state interactions and final state interactions with the nucleus. The description usually depends on:

1. Single nucleon current: the assumption that the interaction is with individual nucleons (yes, 1).

2. The transient nature of the interaction (the interaction time is short enough that the nucleon doesn't have time to interact with the rest of the nucleus during the process), which might not exactly match the given options, but maybe that's similar to assumption 2 (nucleus is transparent), meaning that other nucleons don't influence the process—so perhaps the nucleon is knocked out without further interactions (final state transparency). Therefore, 2 is about the nucleus being transparent apart from the chosen nucleon, which allows treatment as if the nucleon is isolated.

3. The effect of the nuclear binding is neglected during the interaction. That would correspond to assumption 4. 

So assumptions 1, 2, and 4 would all be required. Assumption 3, about quarks being non-relativistic, may not be necessary. 

But I recall that sometimes, the impulse approximation does assume that the nucleon can be treated as free, which could require that the internal structure (quark configuration) isn't altered. If a nucleon in the nucleus has modified quark structure (like due to binding or medium effects), then the interaction cross-section would differ. However, generally, the impulse approximation assumes that the nucleon structure functions are the same as in free nucleons. To ensure that, you might need some condition on the internal quark dynamics. However, in nuclear physics, unless specified, even if quarks are relativistic, the nucleon is treated as a point particle with the same form factors as free. Maybe assumption 3 isn't necessary. So perhaps 1, 2,4 are required. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, assumption 3 could be a trick since some models do treat quarks as non-relativistic (like in some quark models), but actual impulse approximation typically applies more to the nucleon level. 

The question says "which of the four assumptions jointly imply this approximation". Since there are four options, maybe the correct answer is 1, 2,3 ,4? But if three are required? Wait, the options are the four statements, so the answer is either all four or some subset.

But secondary check: The Rosenbluth formula, or factorization in electron scattering. Impulse approximation usually ignores final state interactions and nuclear binding during the interaction. Let me think. If the interaction is mediated by a virtual photon in electron scattering, then the photon couples to individual nucleons (1). The nucleus is transparent (assumption 2), so no multiple scattering. The nucleon is off-shell due to binding, but in impulse approximation the off-shellness is neglected (assumption 4: proceeds as if no binding). Then the quark internal motion: to assume that the coupling to the nucleon's current is similar to free, we might need their internal structure as in free, which would mean that their dynamics (relativistic or not) haven't changed. But actually, nucleon form factors in the nucleus could differ due to medium modifications; however, impulse approximation would say to ignore those and use the free form factors. Therefore, probably to justify this you must assume that the internal quark dynamics (non-relativistic), like their state is not affected, but if they are non-relativistic maybe the structure is more stable. But I think this might not be an explicit assumption typically; usually when you use the impulse approximation, you neglect the modifications of the nucleon structure in the nucleus, but whether the quarks are relativistic is more an aspect of the nucleon model.

In typical nuclear physics explanations, when they discuss impulse approximation, quarks in nucleons are not considered. It treats nucleons as fundamental particles (except perhaps in some more modern approaches, but traditionally). So assumption 3 might be irrelevant, because the problem is phrased at the nucleon level.

Therefore, maybe the correct options are 1,2,4. In that case, binding forces are ignored (4), interaction is at the individual nucleon level (1), and the nucleus is otherwise transparent (so no other effects—maybe related to final state interactions would come under 2). 

Alternatively, suppose 3 allows the nucleon's structure to remain same as if free. In other words, since the quarks in the nucleons inside the nucleus have the same non-relativistic dynamics as free nucleons (same structure), then the interaction would be the same. However, I think this is less standard. The quark momentum inside nucleons is highly relativistic, so the non-relativistic assumption would be wrong. However, if the approximation needed to ignore the relativistic aspects, thereby matching. But not sure.

Wait, perhaps think of the Born approximation. Sometimes in the impulse approximation, you assume that the probe interacts with a single nucleon, plane wave for the ejected nucleon, and that the nuclear potential does not alter the nucleon’s state during interaction (binding ignored during the interaction). That seems to get to 1, 2,4. Hence 3 even if problematic (since quarks are relativistic) might just be statement that requires the nucleon's internal structure unchanged by medium. Since in reality they are relativistic. So assuming 3 would then imply that despite being inside the nucleus, the quark structure is non-relativistic (unchanged?), which is not true but perhaps a necessary assumption.

But practicing... Okay, maybe the answer is 1,2,4. The original question said which assumptions "jointly imply". Let's look up to verify.
